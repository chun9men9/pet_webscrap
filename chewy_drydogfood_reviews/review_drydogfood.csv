"Dog,Food,Dry Food","I tried Chewy.com because my husband heard about it on TV, and I was complaining to him that my dog food vendor had not had my brand in for 3 months. Responsible pet owners know you can't just change an animal's diet without consequences. I guess my small town vendor wasn't too concerned about their customers, because they are a monopoly.
So I thought I'd try Chewy. I absolutely couldn't believe it when it really arrived in 2 days. I will never drive 15 miles again to get my Hills Sensitive stomach and skin dog food. Yah, chewy to the rescue.","I purchased this through Chewy and went for the huge 30lb bag, knowing my dog eats anything and everything. My mistake!! My 1yr Labrador refused to eat it and left her food bowl full all day :( The kibbles are very large and very very crunchy. I think my dog hated how much effort it took to eat instead of inhaling her food like usual (yes, she's a diva). Tried softening with rice & pumpkin and some broth but nope. back to Pure Vita, which sadly Chewy will not carry for much longer. 


 It came highly reviewed by friends and our vet for her skin issues. However, I had to donate the remaining bag because she stopped eating altogether....moral of the story, start with a small bag to start!!

Upon first reviewing this food, chicken was listed as the main ingredient.
Knowing that he likes white chicken meat (freshly cooked), I hoped he'd like this dry food too.
Usually he will more often than not at least try a new dry food.
Soon after purchasing it I was horrified to see that they've now changed the ingredients to primarily CORN rather than chicken !?!?
However, as I continued to give him about 1/3 fresh white chicken, 1/3 vegetables, and about 1/3 of dry pellets (about 20 pellets), he has readily continued to eat this corn-based dry food.
I don't know whether he really likes it, or whether he's just extra hungry while on a weight-loss diet, (vet said he needs to lose one pound).
I would not have bought this dry food had I first noticed that corn is now it's primary ingredient.
I will never feed this food as the primary/only food for him. But as long as he'll continue to eat it, I will continue including it in his diet for about 1/3 of what I put in his dish, (and 1/3 chicken meat, plus 1/3 vegetables), for the sake of his having a more balanced diet, including grain, and whatever more they've determined to be good for him.
But I'll always suspect that they changed the main ingredient from chicken to corn more so for their own sake to make more money, rather than to give the best ingredients to the animal.

 my dog has had reactions in the past with dr tims pork meal formula. So I suspect the pork meal added to this ""chicken meal"" formula caused the reaction with this new formula.

There is no mention of ,or, addition of fresh meat, or, berries. Berries and fresh meats  are used in 'designer'  foods to entice a dog parent to buy a dream. Dogs don't need berries, they don't digest berries so there is no need to add them to dog food for any other reason than marketing a product to a human. There is no need to add fresh meat to commercially prepared dog foods because all the nutrients of fresh meat are destroyed in the processing of commercially prepared pet food. The 'designer' foods use concentrated protein meals as the main source of protein, the same as Sportmix does.Only difference is the makers of the 'designer' foods throw in a hunk of nutritionally absent, over processed 'fresh' ""human grade protein"" and some worthless berries.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","We transitioned our 11 month old Rough Collie pup from Wellness CORE Grain Free Puppy Formula to this Wild Game Duck, Turkey, Boar & Rabbit Recipe both because she wasn't overly fond of the puppy recipe, and because she's nearing a year old. Where she'd graze all day on a bowl of the puppy food, she enthusiastically ate bowlfuls of this Wild Game recipe, seeming to really like it. However, as soon as she was on this kibble exclusively (without the puppy food mixed in), her bowel movements increased in frequency and ... volume? Though her stools were still firm, she began having to go 4 or 5 times a day, even whining to wake us in the middle of the night to go out. I bought a small bag of the CORE Grain Free Chicken recipe to mix in with the Wild Game, thinking maybe it would help with the frequency of bowel movements. It didn't, mainly because she won't even touch the chicken flavored kibble. So, sadly, because of these issues, we're phasing out the Wellness to try Acana Heritage Meats Formula.

My decision wasn't solely financial - I have been feeding my ""malapal"" Blue Wilderness kibble for almost two years and then, for the last four months, Blue Basics with lower calories. That said, I should have read the ingredients of this Hill's product more closely before ordering because it is largely composed of grains, which are a filler and source of empty calories. After three weeks on the kibble, I notice that my dogs stools are very dry and he still seems hungry after his twice-daily feeding. (He was being fed the recommended amount for weight loss, but I have increased the amount to the maintenance level.) I plan to gradually reintroduce him to Blue Basic when the current bag of Hill's is nearly finished. He may have lost some weight in the weeks it takes him to get through the 33-pound bag, but I believe he will be better off with a kibble with better ingredients. Now a disclosure: I have always added dark chicken meat and a quarter cup of string beans or peas (in hot water to make a broth) to his evening meals, and I believe that a quarter cup of meat was too much protein and fat, so I have reduced the amount to two tablespoons of shredded chicken.

I have been feeding my french bulldog this formula since I got him, so that's been about a year. After doing so much research I decided Orijen was about the best. The ingredients are too notch and the carb percentage isn't too high. 

I love that it's about everything-free. Grain , soy gluten etc. 

About a month ago I started doing some research to see if there was an alternative that could be better and or cheaper. I didn't want to sacrifice quality but just wanted to see what I could be doing differently. My dogs stool was very .. ""temperamental"" sometimes good, sometimes not and I had been attributing it to a sensitive stomach and the treats I was feeding him. 

While true that he has a sensitive stomach, I have since changed brands and am feeding him kibble that perhaps doesn't rival the ingredient list of orijen, but his much better for his digestive health. I initially recommended my mom to start her dog on orijen but he was having similar stool problems and now she's switching her dog too. 

In sum, great quality product on paper but in practice it was just too rich for my dog, despite having pros like being soy/gluten/grain free etc. I have now switched to Fromm and my dogs stools are way more predictable.

I recently moved where this brand was not available, hence trying out mail order.  This dog food comes in a foil, vaccuum sealed bag for freshness.  My first bag from Chewy came in a box unscathed from shipping, however, the food itself was subpar.  Instead of nuggets it was a ground up mess!

At approximately $100 bucks for 25 pounds, it is needless to say I was very unhappy.  I called Chewy and had the best customer care service ever.  They were very understanding, and immediately sent me a replacement bag.  

As for the dog food, its a mystery really.  We surmise the food was the last bit packed in the foil bag from the hopper where it is manufactured (which is now manufactured in Kentucky from Canada).  It would be impossible for this food to come like this (a ground up mess) due to the nature of its packaging unless it was that last bit in a hopper, or it got run over by a semi truck.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","I tried the grain-free, super premium band wagon. Too much protein, too much fat, too many calories for large, adult dogs. My Olde English Bulldogge was barely able to eat 2 cups a day of those kibbles because his weight would balloon. He was always hungry. With his severe chicken allergy, I was left with few choices. In over 20 years of owning 7 Dogue De Bordeaux (French Mastiffs), it was only Nutro Lamb and Rice that was super gentle on their sensitive stomachs and universally loved by all 7. So now my newest dog, the OEB, is 20 months old, diagnosed with moderate hip displaysia, and recovering from elbow dysplasia surgery. However, he has a medium activity level, not low - so the Nutro diet food (Healthy Weight formula) was too few calories for him. Although it's a really great diet food I recommend to owners of chubby pups. I'm relieved to have my new dog on this moderate calorie kibble with increased glucosamine and chondroitin levels, and slightly lower (healthier) fat and protein levels. Too much of a good thing, is a bad thing, as I found out. This large breed formula is made for the typical 50+ lbs, moderately active family dog who is at risk of joint degeneration simply due to aging and size. Well done, Nutro! It is less common to have highly active large breed dogs that need more calories, as I see some complain about in the reviews of this food. But Nutro has Regular Lamb and Rice, and other higher calorie kibble to answer their more unique needs. The only thing that made me stray away from Nutro and to the super premium grain free was the same reason I can only give this great food 4 out of 5 stars - for almost $50 a bag, I would have hoped Nutro would have added some probiotics and just a little bit more Omega 3's to this product rather than relying so heavily on less healthy Omega 6's to give your dog a shiny coat. But all in all, still a wonderful food that now my OEB is gobbling up and doing well on.","I have switched to Nutro lid ingredients lamb and rice for a few reasons.. one because I have GSD dogs who in my case seem to have some allergies to certain foods.. their coats are softer!

This food is pricey, but it's worth it if your pet has urinary issues because it really works provided you follow your vets instructions to feed them ONLY this food. They make treats as well. Anything else will disrupt the pH balance of their urine that this food aims to control.

I wish they made all flavors in puppy size as he likes them all. I learned about the kibble size when breaking his Milk Bones in half. Bull Terriers are a funny breed and things you take for granted with other breeds do not apply here. He likes little bits and pieces of anything or else he tries to wolf it down which means he can choke on it. 
The best part of this food is it is essentially a Ketogenic diet, little to no carbohydrates, which is why his skin is tight as a drum and his muscles are prominent all the time. He maintains roughly 48 lbs at all times. His favorite playmate is a GSD 30 lbs larger than him and she eats a raw diet. Her owner is always commenting on cutting back her food to slim her down as she loves the appearance of my dog. Breed makes a difference as does diet. If he gets a treat it is some of my boiled eggs and or chicken. I am trying to adhere to a Keto diet at present but have a way to go to match him, if I ever do.

Chewy made it easier to try whatever food I wanted for them by offering a 50% off coupon for any brand. After a lot of research I liked what Merrick offered so we tried 2 flavors to start. The beef recipe and the duck recipe. I have a senior dog and a 3 year old. They both loved it. They both leave their bowls clean and they're excited again when they know it's feeding time. They've been on this brand for 2 months now and Merrick will be the brand we will stick too. Thank you chewy for making the transition much easier.","We were a Fromm Family for a number of reasons- quality, value, selection. When Fromm left Chewy, we had to decide what was more important to us- sticking with Fromm (who clearly didn't consider the affects leaving Chewy would have on their loyal customers) or Chewy, who has done anything and everything to look out for the customers as we transition to either finding a new food or deciding to walk.  For us, staying with Chewy was a no brainer.

When Fromm left, Chewy sent out a email with similar options in food to help all of us make some new choices AND great deals as we experimented with these new options. We have 7 Mini Dachshunds and a Cairn Terrier- most are now senior, some with back issues, some with Cushings, etc. Fromm met all our needs in one bag of food that was a great price. 
The first option we tried was the Merrick Grain-Free Real Texas Beef+Sweet Potato Recipe Dry Dog Food. My dogs are not picky eaters so that was no exception. The food seemed oily to me which is usually a good sign of fat content which helps with skin and coat. The color was uniform which means they aren't using artificial coloring. My issue really is that Merrick is owned by Nestle and based on the way these mega companies operate, I have to wonder if the price is worth what we are actually getting. I used to get a 33 lb. bag of Fromm for $53.99. Grain free options don't usually come that large and Merrick was a 24 lb. bag for $56.99.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","I have a German Shepherd who suffers from terrible allergies and the only food he can eat is either venison or kangaroo. He absolutely hates the kangaroo and absolutely loves the Venison and devours it happily which is something he has never done with other food.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","I recently had to make the switch from a kibble of a different manufacturer to the Organix brand of Caster & Pollux.
After consulting with some Staff members of Chewy.com, I decided on this brand because I prefer an all-organic life style and eating guidelines for myself, so why not also for my fur children?
My two retrievers made the switch gradually and without trouble, obviously LOVING this kibble and cleaning their bowls!
The kibble size is small, which I like and is easily digested as opposed to larger chunks, which sometimes can be a bit more difficult for even larger dogs like mine, who have a tendency to gulp down their meal a bit too fast.
I love the ingredients and the fact that this kibble is available in a Grain-free style is an extra bonus.
We switched just very recently but so far, we have nothing but praise for this dog food and my retrievers happily look forward to their meals, have good elimination and plenty of energy.
I want to especially mention how helpful Chewy.com has been in accommodating me with advice, the ever-so-speedy shipping, the kindness of the Staff and their overall consideration. Very rare in this time and age and very much appreciated!

On its surface I can certainly appreciate the idea of giving my dog something made from meat more than corn.  So when Nutro offered to send me a free bag, I thought I'd give it a try.

That said, from what I've read the jury is still out on whether grain free food is really better for dogs.  I'm not sure potatoes and lentils are any more natural for dogs than corn.

No runs, no vomiting, and we can can even mix a very small amount of a more complex food to give a little vitamin boost.

I actually talked to someone who had visited several dog processing plants across the country. Said California Natural found the hang up (some clogged joint due to a faulty pump, I think?). They now shut down, clear, and test regularly not just periodically after last problem beyond what most plants do. Cal.Nat. called the recall on themselves (one or two years ago?) and were not compelled by adverse circumstances. He also said the health caution had been for children who might  handle the pet food, but that dogs and human adults would not have been affected (if I understood correctly). The young man I spoke with was employed by a store that does not sell the brand (unfortunately for me, it doesn't sell fast enough). IMO that makes his feedback likely more legit. 

So relieved we found this brand at a somewhat affordable price. Pretty happy with the autoship too. It shipped quickly upon first order, so yay chewy.","I think this is a good food.

Her stools had been very loose for a long time, she had gained weight, and her skin condition wasn't good. My vet recommended a lower fat diet (although she did poo-poo grain free). I did some research and decided to give FirstMate Pacific Ocean Fish a try. 

I slowly transitioned my girl over to FirstMate, over the course of about 2-weeks and she has been on FirstMate for 1-month total. I started seeing **immediate** improvement with her loose stools, which are now appropriately firm. Her coat is looking shiny and really healthy. Shedding has minimized considerably. Her energy has picked up and she has begun to lose weight. And, she absolutely LOVES the taste. As one other commentor noted, is definitely stinky. But who cares if she is excited about her meals?

The kibble is extremely dense so I mix in about 4 tablespoons for chicken bouillon, because my girl doesn't like plain dry kibble. She's about 68 lbs (needs to come down to 58-60), and I'm feeding her about 2 cups of kibble a day.

I use less food per day than other brands because it is such good quality.  Sam has weird allergies and hasn't reacted at all to this.
