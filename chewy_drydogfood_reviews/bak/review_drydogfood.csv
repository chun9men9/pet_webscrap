"Dog,Food,Dry Food","We started this Wellness brand grain-free dogfood when Acana stopped selling their food through Chewy. Wellness Core Grain-Free Original Turkey and Chicken rates a 5 on Dog Food Analysis, which is their highest rating. It has been an easy adjustment for our 7.5 yr old goldendoodle. At the end of her last bag of Acana we started mixing 1/2 old food and 1/2 new food. She's now been totally on Wellness Core Grain-Free for several weeks and we haven't seen any changes in her poo & no gas! Highly recommend!","Based on the reviews I just had to try it on my finicky Husky/Shepherd mixed. We were on another dog food and she wasn't feeling that after a week. To make a long story short, my dog did not like this one bit. She would sniff it and leave it alone. After day two (I thought she might of had an off day) she still didn't touch it. I called chewy.com and she told me they would refund my money and she helped me chose another dog food (yes I paid). This dog food was great! I could barely fill her bowl before she had her head down in it. Wellness Core didn't work for me but I'm glad others have found it useful and fitting for their furry babies.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","I got this food for my dog after getting a prescription from the vet. She had a uti and they recommended she eat this food for a month to see how she does on combo with antibiotics. 

I feed my cat the feline urinary so and have been for almost four years after he developed urinary crystals, and he's done well on it. 

This food is pricey, but it's worth it if your pet has urinary issues because it really works provided you follow your vets instructions to feed them ONLY this food. They make treats as well. Anything else will disrupt the pH balance of their urine that this food aims to control. 

Chewy is amazing because they have the best price I've found for this food in the four years I've been purchasing. They have very fast shipping and discounts for autoship. I was able to email the prescription for both pets to expedite the approval for chewy to ship this item. 

I recommend buying this food from chewy to anyone I know who feeds this to their pet.","Difficult to rate the diet as the reason for getting it was to dissolve bladder stones.  My vet suggested we try it before surgery.  We fed it to our bichon exclusively for one month and it did not dissolve the stones.  
The dog did however love the kibble and wet food and treats.  He seemed to like them better than what he had been eating.
We had the stones surgically removed and he is now off of the Royal Canin Urinalysis SD food.",Highly recommended!,"I got this food for my dog after getting a prescription from the vet.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","My dog started out with Bison - suggested by breeder - before he was a year old I switched to TOTW. He likes all the flavors but he prefers puppy kibbles.  I wish they made all flavors in puppy size as he likes them all. I learned about the kibble size when breaking his Milk Bones in half. Bull Terriers are a funny breed and things you take for granted with other breeds do not apply here. He likes little bits and pieces of anything or else he tries to wolf it down which means he can choke on it. 
The best part of this food is it is essentially a Ketogenic diet, little to no carbohydrates, which is why his skin is tight as a drum and his muscles are prominent all the time. He maintains roughly 48 lbs at all times. His favorite playmate is a GSD 30 lbs larger than him and she eats a raw diet. Her owner is always commenting on cutting back her food to slim her down as she loves the appearance of my dog. Breed makes a difference as does diet. If he gets a treat it is some of my boiled eggs and or chicken. I am trying to adhere to a Keto diet at present but have a way to go to match him, if I ever do.
He has always had too much energy, is sharp and alert as well as sleeps well.
I recommend this food for any breed.","My puppy is about 50 lb & 6 month old... English Bull Terrier
I thought this food would be great but he's not interested in it. I have to mix all kinds of things in it or he won't touch it unless he's starving... I'm sure it's not a terrible option but I couldn't give it a very high rating considering my guy really is refusing to eat it.",4 year old Bull terrier is more fit than most dogs I see.,My dog started out with Bison - suggested by breeder - before he was a year old I switched to TOTW.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","I have a Beagle / Jack Russel terrier mix who is 7 years old.  She was a hair making machine.  The shedding was out of control, not to mention her weight.  I was having to vacuum twice a day, filling the vacuum container each time.  Within a week of putting her on this dog food I could tell a difference.  Now 3 months later I am not finding hair balls everywhere and am down to vacuuming because of dirt not dog hair.   Her weight has started to drop as well.  This is how all dogs should eat.  Thank you sooooo much.  I review few products but was compelled to on this one because it has made such a huge difference.",,Best dog food ever!!!!!!,"I have a Beagle / Jack Russel terrier mix who is 7 years old.

"Dog,Food,Dry Food","My purebred Corgi has always had a sensitive stomach and loose stools.  It made life more difficult as I constantly had to wipe her fluffy little bottom after each loose stool and I'm sure it was uncomfortable for her.  Our vet prescribed Hill's Science Diet Digestive Care and, poof!, no more tummy troubles and no more loose stool.  She does like a spoonful of canned pumpkin on top of each bowl, but that just adds to the fiber content, which is what she so desperately needed. Thanks Hill's Science Diet!
