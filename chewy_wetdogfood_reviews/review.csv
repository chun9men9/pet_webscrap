,"My name is Guy, short for McGuyver. Most people call me Butters, though. (That's from a funny show called ""South Park"" that my family watches.) I answer to just about anything, though. I'm a good boy! People tell me that all the time!

Not to long ago I got very sick. I was very scared and thought I was dying! My parents took me to an animal ER. I had pancreatitis, and it hurt something awful! I cried and cried. But the nice ER doctor gave me medicine, and I started feeling better pretty quick.

My parents took me to see my regular vet after the weekend. He told them that I had to be on a special diet. So now I get Hill's Prescription dog food--in a can!!! I used to only get canned food for a treat, but now I get it every meal!

My parents and I absolutely love chewy.com! We get everything that I need -- and sometimes a few extra surprises just for me! Having my food delivered straight to the house really saves my parents a lot of time. It automatically comes every four weeks, so no one has to worry about if I have enough food anymore!!!

Thanks, chewy.com!
Your friend,
McGuyver","I ordered this food since my vet recently recommended that I use it for my senior coonhound, Honey. I had bought the first case from my vet and thought I would give Chewy a try when I was almost ready for the second case. The cans are identical but the case from Chewy was a different consistency. The 1st case from my vet was a stew like food and the case from Chewy was not. Honey didn't mind the difference, but I did.",My mommy and daddy finally get it!,"My name is Guy, short for McGuyver.

,My eight and a half pound Chihuahua was suffering from dehydration she just didn't like to drink water at that much. My vet said one of her dogs was the same way. So this Hill's prescription diet has a high content of water in the food. Although when you open the can it's a full can of food. Anyway she became a happy playful dog and never was before I've had her 5 years and she is 7 years old so I was happy to see her a much happier and healthy dog.,,dehydration,My eight and a half pound Chihuahua was suffering from dehydration she just didn't like to drink water at that much.

,"I have a little cairn terrier named Eddie.  I love the little guy.  He was vomiting often and had loose stools.  I took Eddie to the Vet and his tests results were for pancreatitis.  The Vet said Eddie should be restricted to a low fat diet and recommended Royal Canin Low Fat dog food.  It has worked.  Eddie is doing very well now, and best of all he loves this food.  I mean really loves it.

This dog food requires a prescription and I was getting it from my Vet, but a few weeks ago they were out and I was stuck.  Ordered it from Chewy.com.  They verified the Rx from the Vet and all is well again.  Fair pricing and very fast shipping.  Will be purchasing future orders of this product from Chewy.com.",,Great Product,I have a little cairn terrier named Eddie.  I love the little guy.  He was vomiting often and had loose stools.
