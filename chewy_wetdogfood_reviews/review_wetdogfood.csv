As he's gotten older, his digestive tract has become more sensitive, so my vet recommended putting him on an LID diet. Since we've fed Nature's Variety products to our cat for a while now and she's doing great on Instinct brand, we decided to go with this line.

First, he walked away from the dry food plain, or soaked. So we tried mixing the canned (in this case, the lamb flavor) version of Instinct LID into the food.

I'm sitting here looking at yet another bowl of food, with little pieces of kibble taken out and scattered around the floor beside it, but not a bite of it actually eaten. $30-and-change for the bag of dry food, $30-and-change for the case of cans, and looks like I'll be donating them to our local rescue center.

A huge ""thumbs down"" from the dog who will eat anything.

However, I did check that I would recommend the brand to a friend, because I still believe that Nature's Variety makes a good, healthy, holistic product. I guess it just tastes like sawdust.

(Sidenote: he'll still eat pretty much anything else put in front of him, by the way, so it's not his appetite over-all that is the problem.)",Great extra food,I feed my toy poodle puppy one heaping tablespoon wet mixed into about 1/4 cup dry lamb limited ingredient kibble.

Anyway: got a supplement of hyalouronic acid at the health food store and give Yoda those capsules with her meal.  My veterinarian thinks the hyalouronic acid is ""The Bomb"" that makes the biggest difference for joint mobility; and, I agree.  The canned food is meaty and thick: I scoop out a big round dollop and slice it like meat loaf; then, dice it into smaller bits and mix it in with Buffalo Blue for Senior Dogs: a dash of low-salt organic chicken broth and we're good to go.  ALL of our doggies love it.  I garnish their kibble with a bit of the canned prescription, too; then no one feels left out.  Yum!  Tempted to try it myself!","Dog will be 17 this August and he's showing severe signs of joint disease now... Got this to see if he would eat it (historically, my pets have all shunned Hill's, and I personally have always felt there were better products out there). HE ATE IT!

So, a quickie review:
1 - this is a COMPLETE and BALANCED formula. Some of the SD foods are marked to be fed intermittently or else supplementally, but this one is safe to feed for maintenance and without interruption. I would not give it to a puppy, as the Dry Matter Basis protein is only 20% (adult dogs require at least 18, puppies need more!).

2 - this is the CLOSEST level of DMB Protein I have found! My dog is also showing EARLY signs of kidney disease and I thought that it was a bad idea to reduce his protein intake... Until I researched it and learned that about the minimum for adults (18% based on a dry matter basis), and then checked the foods I had been using in rotation. YIKES, I was killing my dog! I do not feed this alone (I combine it with other lower protein options, ranging from this 20% to 25%), because my dogs have always had all kinds of food and they don't typically accept a ""bland, one food forever diet."" 

3 - It mashed pretty easy into some of the kibble that we are NOT buying again... I put about 1/4 the can in to see if he'd eat it and it mashed in really nicely actually: not so wet it stuck to everything and also not so dry it crumbled off the food. It has a pretty good texture compared to what I recall of the old SD foods (which were like... gel...). 

4 - NOT a fan of the first 6 ingredients: Corn is the 6th and corn is usually 1, GMO (genetically modified to be either a pesticide or herbicide resistant by producing its own toxins), and 2, not as easy to digest or available for nutrient absorption. And what by product of pork are we talking, exactly, here, Hill's? Organ meats are considered a by product, and I have fed raw organ meats before in my rotation, so that wouldn't bother me. I'm hoping that's what it is (and not something higher in protein but WORTHLESS to digest, such as feet/hoof material...).

I paid 2.79 per can at the veterinarian's office, and Chewy has it .04 cheaper. I'll be buying from Chewy since I'm mixing about 1 can a day into the rest of his food. Not my favorite product but I definitely have to admit that it at least doesn't turn my dog 100% off and make me feel awful for trying to add more ""joint stuff"" in when and where possible.

6 - the only OTHER complaint I have about this food is the same as the ones coming out of California right now: there is nothing in this formula indicating that it REQUIRES a prescription to purchase. You can buy higher amounts of glucosamine and the rest of the ""joint compounds"" in concentrated doses pretty much anywhere without an Rx. It annoys me that I have to get an Rx for it, and I'm not sure who exactly enforces this but it's a bit silly, considering I bought it at work today (ok, I work for a vet...) WITHOUT an Rx. My boss didn't think I needed one, but ok, I'll get it... 

Bottom line: Great food to add into your dog's diet, provided you account for calories and ingredients/nutrients and adjust the rest of the diet accordingly. BEST DMB protein level I've found to date, for those seeking safe foods for kidney dogs too!",Yoda: Food for Joint Mobility,Yoda likes the Hill's Prescription diet canned food.

I bought a case of this just to prove to myself it wouldn't be an option for them. The first day I fed them a few fingers full of it and they went nuts! They ended up eating the whole can as a snack. I thought they'd all have diarrhea or be sick from the sudden change. They all digested it perfectly! Within 3 weeks of being on this, my Italian Greyhound, who was very thin and losing her hair, began growing her hair back and gaining weight! My chihuahua with ulcerative colitis handled it perfectly too. I am simply amazed. It is a little stickier and thicker than the Natural Balance venison & sweet potato they were eating before, so I add a little water to thin it out a bit. Without the water, it seems to stick to the roof of one dog's mouth, but my other 4 don't have this problem.","The dogs love this food.

Mommy kept saying it did not look good for Riley. I don't understand this: Mommy and Daddy in April, 2013 took Sasha to the  vets. Sasha never came back home to me Margo and Riley. Mom would try to talk to me about Sasha, but could only cry!! (She still cannot talk about Sasha without crying.) Then in August, 2016, they took Margo to the vet. She didn't come home!!i 
So Daddy feeds me in the morning and Mom feeds me at night. I like when Dad feeds me. He is not stingy with the Taste of Wild canned!! Mom keeps my on a diet!! They mix a couple of tablespoons of TOW mixing it in with my dry (Taste of Wild). It is SOO good. I think I like the TOW canned,  better than table-scraps!! AND I do know that the dog food is much better for me. 
When I eat TOW dry with the canned TOW, I look DARN good!! My coat gets so shiny, and soft, almost silky!!!

Now I am going tell a secret, DON'T, PLEASE, do not tell my Mommy or Daddy!! I sometimes act like I am not being a good eater. See, i know they will get worried about my not eating !!

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","Having read the other reviews for this product, in particular, and Weruva, in general, I really, REALLY wanted to like this canned dog food. But, the long and the short of it is that only one of my 2 dogs likes it, and I am just not wow-ed by this product.

I really like that Weruva makes their products in facilities with human-grade standards. I really like that Weruva uses only wild-caught tuna and does not accept tuna from unlisted, unregistered fishing boats. And, as the other reviews, and Weruva itself, point out, you can see chunks of tuna meat in the product. It is not a homogenized mush, but similar to a human-grade soup. You see chunks of vegetables as well. It is much lower in fat than most canned dog foods (see nutritional analysis below). I very much like the fact that pumpkin is the chief vegetable ingredient (one of several), which is very nutritious and less problematic than potato for allergic dogs. And, to be fair, one of my two hyper-allergic dogs absolutely loves it!

So, what gives? Why do I not recommend this product and only give it a 3.0? Because you (and I) pay up to $10 more per case than the average premium canned dog food for a product that is less than 10% protein for all that, and the can is labeled ""Product of Thailand."" Over and above that, although there are indeed chunks of tuna in the product, there are not that many; most of the tuna is still in flakes. This is the first time that I have used a Weruva product. I also notice that I am writing this review a year later than 2 of the other 3 reviews. Perhaps the formulation/recipe for this product has changed in the meantime. I just don't know.

Here is the nutritional analysis: Crude Protein #min#: 8%; Crude Fat #min#: 1.4%; Crude Fiber #max#: 0.5%; moisture #max#: 85%; Ash #max#: 1.5%.

It just seems that a person can spend his/her money more sensibly than on an expensive product of only 8% protein that is a ""product of Thailand"" and which only one of my dogs loves.",,Our dog Mackenzie loves it!,"I know that this product is more expensive than most, but it has certainly been worth it. Mackenzie was very sick and not eating. I thought I'd try Weruva, as I feed it to my 2 cats. She dances when she sees it coming and licks the bowl clean!

His poop is excellent and he is maintaining his weight. So far so good & my fingers are crossed! I sometimes add some dried venison kibble or maybe a cracker because this brand is not as dense/dry as the other brand, but he still likes it plain. I hope this helps other folks who struggle with their dog's stomach problems.","I have been feeding my shih-Tzu this flavor for the past 6 months due my little boy's stomach issues.
