"Dog,Food,Wet Food","I thought I would try a case to see if the price justified the purchase. Sad to say both of my dogs didn't see to like it at all. They are quite a diverse duo, both rescues. One is a Brittany Spaniel the other a large Terrier mix. They didn't eat very much of it at all, I ended up dumping most of it out. Not sure what to think, but I am going to try something different next time.

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","My Rottie pup has been on the Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein diet for almost 3 months due to severe protein allergies. One day he just looked at me and said ""Nope, not eating this anymore"". I tried everything short of standing on my head to get him to eat. Called the vet, she said we could now try one of the selected protein formulas. He went nuts when I brought it home and filled his bowl!! The hydrolyzed protein formula saved his life and stabilized his digestive system which allowed time for it to heal, but I think the flavor was lacking. Now that he is on an actual meat formula he is so happy! Another prescription was needed for this food also, but Chewy got on the phone with my vet right away and shipped it out the next day! So far my pup has been eating this formula for a week and we haven't seen any adverse reactions. Once again, thank you Royal Canin for making quality foods for our special needs pets and thank you Chewy for working so fast to get my pup his much needed prescription food!","we're testing my little guy for food allergies, which has severely limited food options.  He wouldn't touch the dry kibble until I added this canned food and mixed them together.  Then, he licked his bowl clean.  The only drawbacks are that I had to buy so many cans and that they are large cans which take forever to use up if you have a small breed dog.",My Pup Loves This Stuff!!,"My Rottie pup has been on the Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein diet for almost 3 months due to severe protein allergies.

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","My 4 year old Papillion sometimes eats the Pro Plan Chicken and Rice Canned by itself.....I feed him about 1/4 of a cup in the am and pm.  Then again, he is such a finicky eater, he will not eat this at all.   So, he does not get anything to eat either in the am if he does not eat, or in the evening......once he is hungry, he will eat the canned.

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","Our Jack Russell / Italian Greyhound mix was getting tired of her old topper (Nature's Recipe), so I tried this one. She LOVES it! Jumps in the air with glee while we are getting it ready and wolfs it down in record time!
I hope she does not tire of this one - there seems to be no sign of that happening any time soon!","My doggy is a 10 year old long haired chihuahua who is EXTREMELY picky about his food. Generally, I have to either give him wet food with his dry food or just by itself and he will eat all of it up in seconds! That was not the case with this food unfortunately.

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","How would I know how great it is....it is only dog food which is made from ingredients from human food so no big deal people..I taste it..some dog foods are disgusting tasting...too salty...too bland yet you expect your dog to eat it....the flavors this brand of food and the quality and taste is the best...my dogs live to 17 to 20 years old and 70% of their diet is human food and the other this brand. The puppy food is superior quality to any other brand as well. Here's the thing, I breed Shih Tzu's and years ago dogs lived until they were the age my dogs live to now, everyone cuts out grains and gluten or whatever and they live much less. We fed our dogs all that back then, not now and the vets' offices are full of sick dogs. The unnecessary shots you jab your dogs with doesn't help. Years ago one or two vets in a small town, now there's as many vets and dentists.

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","It is a decent product but like so many others, it is too pricey.  I have 7 personal dogs and 11 rescue dogs.  I like to feed them quality food but the prices are prohibitive.

"Dog,Food,Wet Food","My dog's trainer cuts this up and uses it as treats and the dogs go crazy for it! You need to keep it refrigerated but I usually just cube it up, put it in tupperware, and pull it out for training sessions. It's great because you really get a lot for your money and the soft texture is better for training than hard treats. I also feel better giving my dog another food as her treat, it seems to be easier on her stomach and she isn't gaining extra weight from the ""treats"" I recommend the chicken flavor over the beef though!",,Great for treats!,"My dog's trainer cuts this up and uses it as treats and the dogs go crazy for it!
