"I was surprised my two large dogs didn't like this food more;  it looks wholesome enough...and the ingredients seem fine.    They eat it but not with gusto.......one dog kind of noses around the meat, eating the kibble and then tentatively eating the meat chunks.  I think I will look on Chewy again for"
Selected this food because of the nutritional review I read.  Dogs age at first but then tapered off.  Rectangle chunks in gravy.  They are very picky and this did not do it....either.
"This Was supposed to have Rice with Beef Chunks in Gravy.  There Was
Beef Chunks ONLY in Gravy.  I Have Been Buying Nutro Products For Years.
Therefore, I Was Surprised & Disappointed."
"I used to buy one of these rolls every few months to cut up for treats to use when training. Dogs loved them, they were easy to handle and stored well in the freezer. Small pieces could be tossed to the dog when teaching a stay.The formulation has changed. This is a finer grind, wetter and stickier. "
Except that this particular variety gave her diarrhea within a couple of days. I'm stuck with 10 cans of it.
3 out of 12 cans were dented. Lynn is very picky and I think she noticed {HA HA]. Ordering on-line is easier than trying to carry home every other week.
"I have two small senior dogs.  My corgi mix liked the pro-plan for a week or so.  My chiweenie did not, and she eats everything! I like that the chunks of meat are smaller in size.  I did not care for the overly thick sauce."
"I'm torn on this food.  It smells so bad to me that I can't hardly stand to open it, but my super picky dog actually really likes it a lot so I guess I'll keep buying it for now haha"
"I know most dog food smells kind of like poop, but this stuff literally reeks like it's already been digested. Seriously. I guess that would be okay if the dogs actually liked it but alas, they just aren't that into it. Moving on to a new brand..."
"It's not the one the dog liked. That one was not ground up. In fact, I was going to ask if I can return the unopened second box and substitute the other tripe canned food that I saw on your site."
"I love the Wellness products, but will not order this one anymore.  My pug loves the flavor but the pieces of meat in this particular flavor are much larger than the other flavors.  Too large for smaller dogs. I'll stick with turkey, duck, etc. on my future orders."
"I tried this product because I like others from the brand and needed something for my GS puppy. This is a pate food but it's a very hard pate and my puppy just doesn't care for it at all. I tried feeding to my other dogs so I didn't waist an entire case, but they don't like it either."
"Our 6-month-old Newfie/Poodle mix puppy loved the food but had digestive issues from the start. We thought she would get used to it, but never did unfortunately. We're still searching for a large-breed puppy wet food."
"After reading about this food, I thought our doodles ""might"" like this food! Unfortunately, it was not to be! They just  took one sniff and walked away...I let it set out for them, but nope...they just would not take one bite. I have to admit..I go by the smell of the foods I feed my pets, both the dogs"
"Unfortunately, my puppy won't eat this food. I wish 
I had not purchased a case, but could not find it in my local store. No doubt, it is nutricious."
This food smells good but it is real stickie.  It is hard for my dogs to eat
"I made the mistake of not noticing that this was packaged as a case of 6 cans, not the typical 12 cans that are most commonly advertised. I was shocked when I received the order. This is ridiculously expensive for only 6 cans of food (approx $5 each) that my dogs weren't overly fond of. It was absolutely"
My 12 week old French Bulldog had about 20% of his food mixed with this. Couple of hours later I found him scratching and crying. He didn't like this at all and he had an allergy. Three stars because the customer service in Chewy is EXCELLENT. They processed my refund and told me to donate the rest of
"This is really a nice product. Great size, great quality. I've fed turkey, beef, salmon and rabbit to my cats. Unfortunately, only 1 of my 7 cats is a guarantee to stay for dinner when I put this down. I actually finished off a can by adding the ""liquid"" from another wet food to this food. They all dined"
This food is runny with gelatin all around it and my dogs do not like it at all! I ?? ?? Chewy though
Many of the cans I received were dented at the seam of the can.  So I don't know if the seal has been broken and if it is safe to feed my dog.  Very dissapointed.
"not much au jus and that's what I was looking for to top my pup's kibble. so this was definitely not a good purchase for me. however, the quality is good. i purchase the pouches of the (Weruva) BFF for my cats and that is a great gravy product."
"This OK as canned dog foods go, not smelly, and nice texture.
I use it alone with the dry food."
"Caesar's food is great. Rowdy loves it. Your packaging was poor, allowing the Caesar's box to pierce the Nustriscia dog food bag to be pierced, spilling the contents. You guys need to package these products separately to prevent this damage."
"Product looked good, but my one year old Rottie didn't like it. There wasn't a problem with any of the food being out of date,etc., only problem we had is it wasn't fitting to my dog's palate. Thought I would try it because it sounded good to me! So much for our tastes being alike:-)"
"Although I do like Merrick for the last 10 years, I did not like this one that well.  It smelled cheap and was mushy."
"I have a ""new"" rescue who has gastrointestinal issues. This dog food has too much fat for her. In addition, it packs a lot of other things into the food which could present an issue, if she has any food sensitivities or allergies."
Unlike some of the other flavors that Nature's Variety has the Venison is too dry for a canned dog food. No gravy at all in the cans.
"I had been buying this for years? Why did Castor & Pollux change the recipe? Not only the recipe but the texture,  it's very messy, and super watery.  Some of the chunks in other flavors are way too big for small dogs. One can had about 20 blueberries in it, way too many.  Not worth the price anymore"
"Our dog has health issues so we try to keep him on a sugar free diet. We have tried a few different brands but this one was not that successful. The smell is off-putting and the dog will eat it eventually, but it's definitely not his favorite. We'll not purchase this brand again."
My pet did not like it at all.  Fortunately my sister's dog gobbled it up.
I needed a breakfast food for my puppy mill dog with no teeth. I thought this product would be like a pate. It  was soupy and has stringy pieces of chicken. Neither of my dogs would touch it. Both refused at a second offering for dinner and then mixed with their regular food next.  The price is not the
Most of my cans when I opened were just the gravy no chunks or food in it at all. Waste of money.
"I didnt inspect the ingredients carefully enough before purchasing this. The third ingredient is turkey liver. From past experience I know that my toy poodles get constipated from any large quantity of organ meat, so I can only give them a spoonful each of this per day. The brand is high quality and "
"Been trying different dog food, not finding anything they love."
I did not see any difference considering the ingredients used in this food. Flavors are average protein and my dog's aren't to picky but did not seem to excited to eat the food. They ate all around it then ate it last after everythung else in thier bowls. Probably won't purchase again and will donate
"I have one of those dogs who will eat ANYTHING. He's never refused a food. We've always said that if this dog ever turns away a food it has to be reallllly bad stuff.

As he's gotten older, his digestive tract has become more sensitive, so my vet recommended putting him on an LID diet. Since we've fed"
This dog food and several others I have tried is sticky like paste. Watching my dogs try to eat it is like giving a dog a big spoon of peanut butter.
"My dog eats the Newman's Own Organics, and it receives good reviews. It is also less expensive than the previous food that I was feeding. But I thought it had an odor and didn't look terribly appealing. My dog does eat it, but I don't think he eats it with the same gusto as he did his previous canned"
My dog will not eat this at all.  I did buy the reduced formula for an overweight dog and she loves it but she will eat just about anything. :)
But my picky eaters won't eat it. I'll keep trying.
Dog on fish based diet ate it reluctantly after the first couple of days.  Other dogs not on the diet thought it was fine.
"With all the dog food out there its often hard to say what is good or not. I heard of this through a coworker and his dog trainer recommended it. But I was disappointed to find it was such a processed product, looking like mush which I hate. I prefer food that has more whole food in it and has some toothsomeness"
Dogs ate this right down on day 1 but slowly tapered off with additional feedings.  They have become very fickle since.  The food is a little soft - tried mixing with kibble.  They are very picky and I'd hoped this solved the issue but it doesn't appear to be the case.  Didn't meet our needs but might
"The chicken entree is very dark meat.
The turkey entree is also very dark meat.
My Chihuahua's LOVE chicken breast and they snub this entree unless late in the day, and they are extremely hungry, then they pick at it.
The beef entree seems to be accepted better. My three cats get into the beef entree"
"The food is suitable for older dogs, I think because of its consistency.  I'd prefer the diced version with vegetables and I think he would too."
"I love many cans of Evanger's but when I saw all these chicken bones,even though they were supersoft.....no way!
It doesn't feel right to me and I will never buy it again."
"Again, my beagle boston has refused to eat this brand of food, even canned.  I am in search of food she will reliably eat."
"While both dogs found the taste irresistible, the one with the sensitive tummy couldn't tolerate it. Compared to some prescription bland diets, it does have a higher fat content, so perhaps that's why?"
"My dog ate the 1st one.  Now, he wants nothing to do with it."
"I wanted to try turducken after reading all the positive reviews, i was so disappointed when neither of my dogs would touch it and i was now stuck with 11  cans."
"This wasn't my dog's favorite, but he's a really picky eater. It did appear to be a good looking food with quality ingredients and I like that it's grain-free."
My chihuahua don't like it. They like t he whole chicken thigh one.
My dogs won't even touch this product. Im totally dissapointed..
Sorry. I ordered this product hoping it would be a good change for my ever sensitive Dane but it gave him loose stools. It is rated highly and is probably very good. It's not the product but my dog that doesn't seem to work well.
"Upon receiving it I found that half of the cans were fairly well damaged at the top and made opening them pretty difficult. 

I'll try one more time because the price and convenience still makes it worth it but I'll have to go another route if I receive so many damaged cans again."
"I have a GSD that is used to getting canned food mixed in with his dry.  I thought that this would be a welcomed treat so I purchased a case.  What a mistake, he prefers to eat his food dry rather than have this mixed in and that is saying a lot. He favors fish products so I don't know why he won't eat"
"The first few cans were beautiful & looked just like the meat on the can - my dog LOVED it.  Next cans with Best By dates of APR 2021 & AGU 2021...(not a typo, that's how its on the can!) look like some whitish/grayish mystery meat & kinda smells like tuna.  The dog literally sniffs it & walks away.  "
"This doesn't even deserve one star, but it was required.  Very disappointed in this product.  Mostly liquid, with a few pieces of the veggies and a small hunk of chicken with the bone still in it.  Also, several of the cans were dented, apparently before packing, as the packaging material was intact."
Unfortunately my dogs are not as excited about it as I thought they would be.  Still good quality and smells good.
"My pug eats anything and of course she loves it. My picky eater however is not very enthusiastic. She will sit and stare at her bowl for a minute before she'll eat it. The smell is horrible. Smells like a dirty dumpster. So if you can get over the smell, its not so bad."
"Great food, I just don't think my dogs liked it. They are very small dogs and the chunks were huge with tons of gravy. Sticking with the other textures."
"My senior poodle has refused to eat this. It's consistency is pate'.
My terrier ate a little but then walked away. Tried several times on different days. 
Now have cans of expensive food my dogs won't eat. 
But maybe other dogs like this. Mine don't.
Poodle is approaching 16, he's a picky eater. 
"
"My dogs have eaten the same three Cesar dog food products for the last 10 years. With the last two shipments from Chewy of a variety of these three flavors, none of my three dogs will touch the food...not even after not making any other food availabe for a whole day. I don't know if they are being stored"
"my Old chi liked this for 2 whole cans, and then he said nope, all done. My terriers loved it but they are not picky at all. It has a very soft, mushy texture like pate."
"I'm happy with Holistic Select in general (my dogs eat the dry food), but my pups wouldn't touch this. My Cotons are not picky gals and always up for food, so this was surprising and frustrating. I HATE that you have to buy a whole case---wasted $$$."
"Your ad should say that the can has to be opened with a can opener, unlike other Newman canned dogfoods.
I find the contents greasy and fatty."
"My dog hates pate style canned food. I was expecting this to be actual chunks in gravy, however, it's not. It's pate. It smells good but I can't serve this to my picky eater."
"Contents are as described, but most of the cans were dented in the case of 12."
"My dog is picky and doesn't like it, but it;s healthy."
"Great food, but 6 of the 12 cans badly dented. I hope threw the really bad ones away for fear it may have been dented enough to break the seal. Otherwise, the food itself is great- worthy of 5 stars."
"This did not work out for my diabetic dog, the food is too watery/wet and must be mixed with dry food. But I like the grain free aspect of it. It's still pretty mushy when mixed with dry food."
"My dogs love Blue Buffalo products, but they were not too crazy about the Turkey Day Feast canned dog food. I bought this around Thanksgiving and added some turkey to it and they ate it but not without the turkey added. I'm not sure what they didn't like about it."
"My Border Collie eats it, but then he isn't a fussy eater. The ingredients are all finely ground into a sticky paste that requires a second spoon or a finger to get it off the first spoon. Then it sticks to the second spoon or finger.  It just seems to stick to everything. Since the ingredients are finely"
"Not sure why but none of my dogs liked this food. I got the chicken and the beef but for some reason they smell the food, gave me a weird look and walk away. I have 2 morkies under 10 pounds and the female eats anything but this food did not please her at all. I really hope they would like it. I brought"
I really like the fact that this food isn't full of a bunch of stuff our pets don't need.  Unfortunately my bulldog didn't care for it.  I wound up having to mix it with her regular can food to get her to eat it - but she was reluctant.
I will never know whether this is a good food or not because I will not buy any food for my 8 babies because it has Carrageenan in it.  I only buy ones that don't have it.
I've been feeding Evo chicken and turkey canned for a few years. Just received two cases from Chewy (who are a great company to buy from!) and knew right away it was different from previous order; the can lid and then the consistency and colour are different. Checked the ingredients to an older can and
My little dog would not eat it. It was the consistency of pudding. My dog likes wet food but with some small chunks of food. Not a fan of mushy food.
There are chunks of meaty stuff covered in gooey gravy. I'd rather my dogs have solid meat than gravy filler.
This is my second and I was pleased with everything except the Royal Canin Poodle which I ordered to try with my older dog that has been picky.  this didn't work and since i have STANDARD POODLES it is hard to know what effect this food will accomplish with this size dog.  I look forward to the new order
"The dogs will eat this, but they don't like it.  They do like one of the others of Newman's Own."
SAD BUT RIGHT NOW DOGGIES CAN NOT EAT IT-THEY CAN ONLY EAT DRY FOOD FROM THE VET WOULD RATHER FEED MY DOGS CHICKEN AND TURKEY
"really bad stuff, just a mush in the can.  my dogs wouldn't touch it and they eat just about everything.."
The reason for the 3 stars is because of the price. It is expensive but you do get real chicken. Also for the 3 stars is because of the fat/liquid that is on the top of the chicken. Not sure what it is and does have a strange odor but my dogs both love the food. I use it as a topper and my Australian
"I thought my dog would flip over such flavors as described. However, she doesn't seem impressed and doesn't always finish it."
"We have given our dogs Wellness before, but this Lamb & Sweet Potato is different.  The food had a fishy smell and I had to coax the dogs to eat it.  My dogs like the brand, but not this particular flavor."
I trusted the labeling on the case of Nutro LAMB & VEGETABLES to be what it said without reading the exact list of ingredients.  When the case arrived it mainly consisted of rice and oatmeal.  I never wanted any grains for my dogs since wild canines don't eat grains.  More irritating it has the texture
"There is too much gravy, meat is little flat squares, there is not much to it. My dog's stools are very loose since she's had this food. I rarely use Purina but decided to try a couple of the new ones. Bad decision. I'll stay with the better brands."
Thought my dogs would jump at this wet dog food. They both like fish so thought it was a no brainer. Neither dog will touch the food- in fact they go in the opposite direction -- so now I have food they won't eat - think maybe I will have to throw it all away - not happy at all
Well One dog loves it the other could care less The one that loves it of course would eat dirt if you let her. The boy is a bit picky trying another brand will see how that works with the Boy.
Horrible food my dogs didn't want to eat at all that food
"Unfortunately my kidney disease pup did not want to eat this food. It may be a great food for other dogs, however it is not the food for her."
"Not sure yet if I like this product,  so far every single can has been filled with more of the sauce than anything... I should have read more carefully before purchasing ..."
I liked that there were not many ingredients in this dog food but my dogs really don't like it. They are eating it because they are hungry however my dogs have been pretty spoiled with homemade dog food for quite some time. They are not doing well with the transition into dog food. I will try it for 
Sadly my three small dogs ate the first can and have not touched it since..Very healthy good quality food from an excellent caring company of long standing. Wish that they offered a variety pack of canned food as I would love for them to eat this brand.
"My 12yo Australian shepherd/pit mix is the Mikey of our family. He eats everything. He loved the steak tips flavor so much that I added this to our autoship order, figuring that he might like a little variety. Nope. He refuses to touch it and is currently on a hunger strike until I dump this out of his"
"My dogs like it fine, but all the cans are dented."
"It smelled good, looked good, but my Bulldog/Pit mix wanted nothing to do with it. Her Vet said due to her allergies I should try a different source of protein for her. I'm sure it would be good for others just not my finicky critter . . . ."
My dog is used to eating Cesar Classics Pate. I ordered these for a change. She refuses to eat them.. The meat is cut in thin strips I tried breaking up the strips but found them very tough Won't order again
"My dog would not touch this food. I thought it would be like the Merrick Wing-a-Ling, however the bones were huge and they were not soft. I am comfortable feeding Merrick's cooked bones, but these were just too big and not softened appropriately. The gravy did not smell good either."
After eating this food our dachshund had terrible diarrhea. I will not try it again.
"My malt/shi didn't really care for this puppy food. It didn't really have a pleasant smell. However, I have used other merrick wet food and it was fine. Could be just this type."
Disappointing because the regular Red Barn beef roll held its shape to slice and cut into small cubes for training purposes while this grain-free version just crumbles and is impossible to cut to cubes.  Loved the regular one but will not order this one again.  Doggy loves it nonetheless!
"My chihuahua ate this at first but she seems to prefer the ""casserole type which is smoother. Otherwise I would have given it a higher rating."
Love the dog food. My order has two slightly damaged cans. It is difficult to get canned dog food shipped to your home without some damage
"BAD PRODUCT. TRIED THE CANNED BEEF, AND SHE BECAME SICK. WAITED A WEEK, THEN TRIED THE CANNED CHICKEN. MADE HER SICK. SHE DOES WELL ON THE DRY LOGIC
JOAN SWEATT"
"My dog likes this food, but the cost is ridicules. And, you can't even get a break buying it by the case, you can only buy a 4-pack. I don't care how good this food is, I will find a comparable food at a more reasonable price. I am only giving it 2 Stars because of the unbelievable price and I don't "
"My puppies didn't like this food too well. The trays smelled more like oatmeal than chicken. It seemed like a nice meal for any dog, but not mine."
"My puppy doesn't like it, at all. Plus has problems with gases after he eats it. I really do not recommend it"
"May be a great grain free food, but why will my non picky eaters not eat it. They will go hungry rather than eat it. Will continue to feed Pedigree."
Disappointed in Wellness. I read on their site the 12.5 oz cans have BPA after I purchased. Do NOT buy!!!
"Like having the food delivered, but if I get anymore dented in cans of food Ill go back to getting the food at the local store..."
My Husky is on special diets for a skin condition that the Vets cannot find a cure. They change his diet and he does not like any of the food they put him on.
"My dog loved it, BUT, I didnt realize the food is made in Thailand. I have heard bad things about pet food from Asia - mostly because of their laws and standards when it comes to making pet food. I will keep lioking for Natural no meat-by-products food made in tbe U.S. Sorry..."
"Disclaimer: I am a ""people-food for doggies"" cynic. My dog only eats ""people food"" when it fell off my plate and hit the floor. Making doggie food look like stew-for-people misses the point. My dog actually likes dog food that I would never want to eat.

I used to mix Iams lamb pate formula with Iams"
"One of the containers had leaked out in the tray, and was spoiled. The contents inside had turned black and smelled horrible."
"due to all the great reviews I was so hopeful I'd found the right food. Cassi will not touch it so now I'm stuck and I guess it is back to the drawing board,  I am so disappointed"
"I don't understand why but our Miniature Schnauzer, who is normally a real chow hound, won't eat this stuff. It appears to be just fine so I have no idea why she is turning up her nose??"
"I almost exclusively buy Blue Wilderness dry food served mixed with canned for my two dogs. I admittedly test out one can purchased at retail and then order in bulk from Chewy if my dogs like it.

Dogs have never had a problem with any other BW product until this one. As a few other reviewers have "
"I ordered a couple cases of wellness and my pups dont like it. Not sure what to do with all this food?
I switched to Taste of the Wild and they seem to like that."
"I bought this for our 2 Shih-Tzu's and they hated it, I ended up giving the case away. Nice donation I guess. Disappointed also that Chewy.com doesn't caring many of the Hills Science diets can dog / puppy food...The ones my dogs like are cheaper at a pet store than on here. That's disappointing also"
"My pitbull would not eat this food. I tried and tried and tried, but unless I was hand feeding it to him, he would totally avoid it."
"This canned dog food is very mushy and soupy.  I have to hide meds inside the food & the consistency makes it impossible.  The dogs seemed to like it, but it really makes a mess when they eat it because they are lapping it up like water."
"Got a call this morning from Chewy that my 12 pack was repackaged and now came in 6 pack. Basically the recipe has changed, I just compared my can to this new, $1.50 a can more. New recipe does not have pork liver, no fruits or vegetables as before. Went ahead and accepted the change this order, but "
"i ordered this and Fruitables chicken broth for comparison and found that despite the two products being more or less identical in quality and quantity, this one was literally 4 times the price of the other one. 3 star rating for that reason."
See above message. I am a canidae buyer for 2 years grain free is my choice and the dogs live the bison dry and moist
"I have two small dogs who are, admittedly, picky eaters. However, I found that the cans within a single case were inconsistently filled. Some had gravy in the cans, while others lacked gravy. The weight of the cans varied as well. It seemed as if the cans came from an off batch processing. I was also"
"I fed this to my 3 medium-large shepherd mix dogs. I mix a little into their dry grain-free kibble. They seemed okay with it at first but after just a few weeks, will not eat it. They love Happy Hips, so that's what I will switch back to."
"Most of the Merrick Lil' Plates my toy poodle will eat, however, this is an exception. She does not like it. Not sure why. I can usually get her to finish it with a coaxing that seems to take days. Will not buy this particular one again."
"Either one of my little girls likes this one, and I bought 24 of them. Now I don't know what to do with the rest of them..."
"I think I may have wasted my dollars with this purchase. My dog will not touch any of these food choices. usually, he will go after his dinner with the other"
"I was really annoyed when I read this food was made in Thailand. I do not care what the other reviewers have said. I will NEVER purchase this canned food again. I use this only as a 'topper' and it smells good but, I am examining each can I open. I order an expensive kibble for them as well as feed Raw"
"I just spoke with a rep from C&P bc my husband and I noticed the consistency changed in the chopped turkey and the shredded chicken dinner flavors we most recently ordered. She said it shouldn't have unless we got the new ""recipe"" which isn't supposed to be on the market until August. Sure enough, both"
Sorry...my dog would not eat it...but my cat loved it.
"I previously bought the big cans of this exact same food. I wanted the convenience of smaller cans = same brand, same type, same label, only smaller can. Previously, my puppy wolfed down the food, the small cans she won't touch at all. I am pretty much at a loss as to why unless the large and the small"
"This was the first and last time I purchase this product. When I opened the roll it was dry and crumbly nothing like the ones I had purchased in the past from a different company also thru Chewy. Unfortunately that item was discontinued so I had to pick something new, but this is not it."
"This food was always good but now we almost stopped buying it because they seem to be adding more fat as a filler for weight. Not sure if we will keep purchasing it. Stopped other foods for same reason. Quality from fat content had gotten sloppy,"
"It's very difficult to find a dog food that my dog can have (allergies), let alone eat. I've tried so many different brands, it's a shame to spend top $$ on products that don't make the grade. My local stores don't carry limited ingredient food, which leaves me stuck with buying a quantity just to try"
"My twin poms have eaten Cesars since they started whole food.  They love the turkey flavor the best..
This senior flavor is not their favorite.  I won't but it again.  But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't."
I recommend all Nutro products my dogs are not fond of this product.
"My dog ate the 1st one.  Now, he wants nothing to do with it."
"I've been monitoring and found at least 10%-15% of the dog food cans coming from Chewy are dented and in two cases the contents were bad. This is unsatisfactory and if it continues, I will cease purchases from Chewy.  

As for the likeability, my dogs are not keen on this brand in any of the flavors"
"In trying to find something my picker eater will chow down on like my lab I thought I give this a try. Lab would it all day but, not my teddy bear. On to something else."
My dogs didn't care for this variety. I'll donate it to a local rescue group.
"I have a Cairn Terrier so I thought it would be nice to try the petite entrees. However, this is so hard to open, despite the tag saying ""easy open."" Quality seems fine, you can see the veggies but my dog doesn't seem as excited about it as he is with Wellness Core. And he gets gas from this. 
Financially"
a mid line product for all dogs to enjoy without an exorbitant price
Not the best for weight management. My bichon is not satisfied and constantly wants more... would not recommend
My dogs don't like it and it doesn't smell very good.
"Have feed my dog Merrick Grain Free Smothered Comfort and tried this product. It is similar, but this product has more gravy and less meat. I also do not like the smell. I will go back to Smothered Comfort."
"I'm sure this is a good product for dogs suffering from IBS and stress. In fact, my pup likes the ID Stress kibble - but the stew she really did not care for at all. In fact, she turned around and tried to cover it up like it was something foul. Not sure why she had such a reaction to it, but I am giving"
"I ordered the wrong recipe.  I opened one can and it really smells like dog food, not like some of the other brands I've ordered in the past."
Not sure if this is a review of the food or a review of my cats. It's like they don't know what to do with food that's made of nearly all meat. The food itself seems to be good quality.  Probably the cats are defective.
"My dog loves the Whole-Earth Red Meat flavor, but doesn't like this one. He's a poodle / Scottish terrier mix."
"Sorry, Newman... Every can in the case has a large lining of solid white hard fat that I need to peel away from the food before serving my dog. It's really gross, terribly inconvenient and wasteful. After separating the non edible portion, I'm literally throwing away at least 20% of each can. Only reason"
"My 7 months Golden Retriever really didn't like this food! I tried to mix turkey, yogurt or treats in his food but NOTHING! I know that Zignature is a very healthy food, but not for my dog. 
After 7 days forcing my dog to eat Zignature (cat fish dry + Zssential canned) I called Chewy and they returned"
I have never had a product from Chewy that my dogs didn't like except this one. The consistency was dry as well. Also two of the containers were open at the corner and the food was spoiled inside (we threw them away). I would never recommend this product.
"It is difficult to rate this item, although our Maltipoo loves fish (home cooked) she would not eat this food.  We tried over several days to entice her to eat the Trout and Salmon.  We the tried various ways to again entice her to eat but to no prevail.  So sorry I could not give a true recommendation"
"Had to try this since the venison was discontinued.  He will not eat it and has not eaten in a few days.  I found one can of venison and he gobbled it up.  So want the venison back.  Luckily, chewy refunded full amount and I donated rest to a rescue center."
My dog liked it at first but now doesn't want to eat it.
"I purchased Blue Buffalo for the first time. The cuts of meats do not look real and it is very watery. Both my dogs will not eat it no matter how long I leave it out, I have tried mixing dried dried dog food too no avail. I will continue with Chewy as I love the Company but not this brand of food."
"dogs love it, may not be the best for them, but, they will eat it"
"I have the worst time opening these cans.  If you pull the tab it sticks close to the end.  When you pull harder then the can pops open and the food goes everywhere.  You told me to use a regular can opener, when I did that it would not completely open the can."
"She seemed to like it but now will not touch it.  I've tried to sneak in a can to use it up but that's not working.  That's the down side to buying a case, but the local food pantry takes pet food too.."
I ordered this meaty mix hoping the fact that it was holistic would be OK for my two Shih-Tzus. My female puppy started to lick her paws almost immediately. I took her to the vet with a can of the chicken entrée and I was told that she was severely allergic to the garlic in the mix. Since there was no
My teenage lab eats the fish flavor but he's not crazy about it. Nothing wrong with the product.
"I had been having issues with a nursing mom eating. I have 6 foods in the house from here all kibble and she would not eat anything. I talked to a breeder friend of mine and she suggested this product. It comes in 8 to a package which is about 1.79 a tub. I always get good products from Chewy, so I ordered"
"Any left over in the fridge turns to brick in a few hrs. Doggie, does not like it when is so firm, even though I mash it as much as I can."
My dog is a picky eater and she did not like the breakfast scrambled egg and sausage. Won't buy that for her again.
"They like the food only it messes their tummy up and stool is loose, with 9 dogs its not fun to clean up"
My dog likes it well enough but it's so hard and compact coming out of the fridge it's difficult and messy.  I prefer feeding time to be much easier.  It's also too expensive for my budget.
"I know my Irish Wolfhounds enjoyed this food, and I am a fan of giving them a lot of variety in their diet, but I won't be buying it again. It seemed like the percentage of actual duck chunks to gravy was insufficient, and I can't see paying this much per can for gravy."
"My daughter has been feeding her dog this food with no problem. I ordered 2 cases and my cases have a white and black substance throughout the cans.
It made all 3 of my dogs have diarrhea, so I have discontinued feeding them this food. I do not know if it was a bad batch, as I said, my daughter has "
"My dog does not like this can of food and now I am stuck with a whole case of it.
Next time I try something different for him, I will sample several cans first."
If my dogs could talk they would say this food is GROSS. They didn't like nor ate it now I'm stuck with 23 cans . I guess I could donate !!!!
"I'm confident in the nutritional content of Nutro, and only buy Nutro, but can't give this a 5 for 2 reasons. 1- my Amstaff doesn't like it. Have a hard time getting her to finish her meal when I've incorporated this. 2- It has wheat gluten."
Was excited for a reasonably priced 'organic' dog food.  We have a picky eater so we usually try out any new food before buying in bulk.  However your brand is not sold in any of the retail stores in our area.  So the risk we took on purchasing this case was HUGE. Not only would she refuse to eat it 
"For the last couple months I have used Evanger's Organics Cooked Chicken (can, grain-free, gluten-free). I was REALLY impressed and pleased with the product! It REALLY looked like ""real cooked chicken""; it was almost white, and you could see the bits of bone/grizzel that had been ground up. Smelled like"
"Dog will be 17 this August and he's showing severe signs of joint disease now... Got this to see if he would eat it (historically, my pets have all shunned Hill's, and I personally have always felt there were better products out there). HE ATE IT!

So, a quickie review:
1 - this is a COMPLETE and "
My Bella is very picky she seems to like this one more than the rest I tried lol but my cat Gretta really likes it lil
We have used Science Diet for our dogs for over thirty years. When we saw Healthy Cuisine we thought an upgrade had been made to the Savory Stew products (we use both Chicken and Beef). It appears more of a 'slush' type product and doesn't compare to the stews.
We are in the process of changing over to canned dog food and my two dogs are a little hesitant with this product for some reason.  They are learning to like it though.
"Both my dogs wouldn't eat, donated to shelter. Smell was bland."
I had never purchased this brand before but I thought I would give it a try. My chihuahua is a very picky eater and I had been trying different food to give her some variety. One whiff and look at this food and she immediately left her bowl. I have to say I agree with her. It was very unappealing in 
"I have a 13 year old springer spaniel. He is lacking teeth, along with several other infirmities. I put him on canned food because he was just swallowing his kibble. He turns his nose up at this food, and I have tried it for several days. My two younger dogs think canned food is a treat, so they are "
My dogs wouldn't eat it. But they eat other Pro Plan food.
I did not know this was pate. One of the steak flavored cans smelled back and my dog would not eat it.
"My Oie, been eating this food for years and loves it.
last few shipments I have been receiving cans that are damaged.normally would not worry about this however,Botulism can happen in dog food cans too. So will be returning my damaged cans. If I get to many I will find a new supplier
other then that "
To my surprise my 2 dogs don't like it that much. It's better for them but they reluctantly eat it. Much happier with other flavors.
"Thank heavens for Wellness turkey/sweet potato, my goldendoodle ""The Homer"" finally has found a dog meat he LOVES!!! He became a picky eater when he turned 2, since then we have tried ALL kinds of food. He has a sensitive tummy and a VERY sensitive nose,,,, with Wellness t/s.p. we are passing all test"
"I have 3 small dogs and had been feeding them Nature's Recipe Grain Free chicken in a broth which they loved and which, I am told, has been discontinued.  So I tried this stew.  Two of the three will eat it reluctantly but the third will not.  Please bring back the other!"
Our dog refuses to eat a single bite. It is very dry and unappealing to me so I added a few small pieces of chicken in the hopes Speedy might eat it. Wrong. I now have 11 unopened cans which I will donate to our local SPCA and hope one of their dogs will eat it.
Top rated but one of my dogs won't eat it. It looks good though
After purchasing this food I came across some reputable dog food review companies that did not rate this particular flavor well at all. Too bad I bought it before finding those reviews. They will remain on the shelf.
My dogs don't like loaf foods.  Ate as last resort.  I will stick to stew like foods.
My dog will only eat Evangers. My little brat loves this stuff. Chewy has a good price on it. My only complaint is that several cans in the case arrived dented. One severely.
"New puppy, 5 months old, sniffed food but did not eat it.
Tried for 3 more times (with different can) and every time she did not eat it. She would dig around the Science Diet food and try to get to the dry food I put on the bottom of bowl.  Previous dog loved Science diet food."
"I purchased this as a topper for the kidney disease food however, she started turning her nose up at this as well as the food it was used as a topper for. Kidney disease dogs do not find much food that they enjoy due to the stomach problems kidney disease presents for them."
"We have two new Shih tzu puppies that don't think much of this food. We have to mix cooked chicken bits with it to get them to eat  ""Freedom Grain Free Puppy"" We will try another food."
The review is not against the quality. The quality is good. Just my guys did not like it at all. One's a picky eater but the other one eats ANYTHING. But he wouldn't eat this.
"There was too much gravy, not enough food. My dog was still hungry after eating. Had white flakes in cans of food. Not sure what they were."
Cats are obligate carnivores--they *must* eat meat. There is no such thing as a healthy vegetarian diet for cats. This may be fine for dogs.
"After the initial ""oh wow this is
 great ! My sr. Dog no longer wants to touch the food. Very sorry to tell you that. Your company is great"
One out of 3 dogs like it. I mix it with Hydro protein and they will eat it but it's  a fight
"I bought this small can to add to my dog's dry food because she has the beginning stages of Kidney disease.
My dog will eat this but i prefer the Royal Canin Renal Support D because it is actually a gravy with morsels, and/or the Renal Support T formula because it comes as slices in gravy. The small"
Two of my three dogs would not eat this product. The dog who did eat a slice did not go to her companion's bowl to eat the slices that were uneaten as it was apparently not worth the effort.  I had to give the food roll to my neighbor who has dogs.
My puppies will eat this but discovered on the can that it actually has no nutritional  value for them. They also try to eat dead animals left in the yard by cats but that's not good for them either. They clearly likely the taste but i won't be feeding this to them anymore and don't recommend for the
"The image of the outside of the can led me to believe it was chunks of meat. I was highly disappointed to see it was mushed meat. What makes it worse is that I bought a case of this slop. My dog eats it through out the day, rather than immediately as he did with his previous Purina wet dog food (in gravy"
"ALL 3 dogs did not like it.
To get them to eat it, I had to starve them for a day.

Personally, I thought it looked and smelled good.
Apparently, the dogs did not.

I Won't be buying this again.
YMMV"
"This brand has been prescribed for my 12lb poodle. We've tried 2 flavors--the rabbit, and the fish and potato. She ate the rabbit for a while, now won't touch it. She has not eaten the fish yet. I keep offering and trying to sweeten the deal with flavorings, but she won't eat it in fact she has had digestive"
"My dogs liked the wet food. I would add a spoonful to the Earthborn dry food. Since I learned where the wet food is made, I will no longer purchase it. I researched a lot of dry food and finally chose Earthborn. I never thought to look where the wet food was made. Thank you to the person that brought"
This is not my doberman's favorite wet can food from Hill's Science diet but he does eat it.  I do not understand why in 2017 do they still make this particular can without the pop top!
The smaller size of this food in the flat tin is much more moist & my puppy likes it better.
My puppy didnt  like the food at all she refuse to eat it as soon as she smell it she walked away after taking lil bites she threw the food up
"My 2 large breed 4 month old puppies, (Aussie and GSD) are surprisingly picky. I ordered this Merrick brand even though it costs $10 more per case than other quality brands, (Chicken Soup of the soul, Science Diet, Nutro). My 2 puppies ate it okay, but the cost is too rich for my blood."
"My dogs, even my non-fussy one, do not seem to like this food. Will not order again. I do feed Nutro dry food and they like that, just not this can food."
Had high hopes for a novel protein but didn't work out for our dog.  Would not recommend this.
Picky allergen prone dog will take it or leave it. Not his favorite but not the worst choice either. He just prefers a different brand.
"I've ordered this item several times because of the gravy amount that by boxer loves, but my last 2 purchases the gravy was thick, like it had been sitting in the warehouse on the bottom shelf, I'm considering finding another brand."
"While my Schnauzer likes this food, I constantly find it coated with some sort of grease--either in the food or with a final layer on the bottom of the food."
Walked away from it - wouldn't eat it.  Extremely unusual for bulldogs they will usually eat anything!
This was a great product to buy online from them until they jacked up the price
"This was a new product for me and unfortunately it didn't agree with my dogs stomachs. I will give the other cans to the shelter.

I have gone back to my Royal Canin Gastrointestinal and the pups are much happier.

I must say though, that's not your fault. You guys are great to deal with. Extremely"
"I ordered this since I needed to put my dog on a low copper diet due to her liver damage. I bought this with the Hepactic Dry food  as well to mix together as my dog is accustomed to wet/dry combination. After a couple days, she turned away from her bowl and walked away. My dog never walks away from "
"My  poor Morgan. He has a real problem finding food. The last food that Chewy recommended was great! But then the brand changed it's formula, and Morgan's tummy got upset. So tried this. A little better on his tummy, but not great. I think with the fruits it has too much sugar for him, plus Morgan is"
I've been ordering this food from Chewy for almost a year now. Always loved the quick shipping and never had any problem with the product. I usually order two cases every time (24 total). The last two orders I have got I wasn't too pleased. The cans were beat up and the food was so runny. I always shake
"My dogs LOVE the dry version of this food, so it made sense to me to try the wet. Not a chance. They won't even so much as taste it. They both smelled at it and walked away. I even tried mixing it with another food. No go. Total flop."
"So far, my dog has been eating this food pretty well. I'm not sure if the stone has dissolved yet. But I will share a tip that Science Diet shared with me....for treats while your dog is eating this food, roll the food into little balls and freeze them. This allows the dog to get a treat while still "
Our Yorkie WILL NOT eat this food! We even tried cutting it in half with something she likes and she still hates it..
I tried one can before I bought the case.  My dog liked it so I bought the case but now she is farting up a storm and eating grass.
Dogs did not care for it  seemed to smell look at twice and turn away had to  run out and get back to their old food
"I have been getting this product for the last 2-3 years. But more recently, there seemed to be a serious decline in production quality. The product is either very dry with hardly and gravy or mainly gravy. This has been happening for the about a year. More recently the case I get is mainly very dented"
"This might be good for small to medium dogs but not to add with dry kibble. Like the Grandma's, thanksgiving to mix for my Great Dane"
The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because our dogs don't like the taste. The quality appears good and they love the rest of the flavors.
The food quality is good however it looks and feels more processed than I would like.
My Chihuahua refuses to eat this. Now I am going to donate it to the local animal shelter.
"Ok. So one of the boxes had rotten food and maggots. Literally. This food LOOKED ok but they won't even touch it. I'm done with chewy for anything except dry food. Surely their warehouse can't ruin that. Or, this is just icky food they don't like. My money is wasted."
"My cats would not eat this. It doesn't have a strong enough smell for them, I suppose. It seems to be a good, healthy food. Dogs would probably like it better."
"My dog likes the top half of the can but refuses to eat the bottom half of the can.  The texture of the food is not consistent.  The bottom half is like wet mush, while the top half is more firm.  Too expensive of a dog food to throw half a can away."
"This is not my favorite of the Blue Basics canned food.  It looks as though it has been put through the food processor.  After refrigerated, it resembles concrete.  But the dogs like it.  They aren't picky."
The ingredients are premium but none of my three girls like the taste of this canned food.  I'll have to mix it with peanut butter and oatmeal and bake it into cookies.
"My 14 year old Shih-Tzu has been on Science Diet Chicken and rice for 12 years. SD changed their original recipe with barley instead of rice. Very soft consistency, more stewish  than pate. Result: she walked away from it. I had to change her canned food to another brand which we finally found, thanks"
"My picky dog did not care for this food.  Not the food fault, my dog is way past picky."
Its good but she knows its not the chicken stew she spits the peas out I dont think she likes them
"Bought an Entire Case of 12 cans..Like the Treats that were also Recommended that Cost $5 a bag of few ounces, they would NOT eat the Treats & NOT 1 out of 4 dogs will eat this Canned food, even though I was told it was the closest thing to their Wellness Dry they've been eating for over 4 1/2 years,"
I recently adopted a 10 y.o. Chi chi and want the best for him. I bought this product based on the Royal Canin name. I was very surprised to read the ingredients label when it arrived (should have researched better). 1. Water. 2. Chicken by-products 3. Pork by-products. There's better for your pooch 
"I'm usually extremely satisfied with Chewy products, however 4 of the 12 cans received were dented. I'm waiting to see if the seal inside of them is damage...then they become garbage."
"At first my dogs ate it readily, now they won't even touch it. Don't know if it's the dogs or the food. Probably the dogs."
Doesn't smell appetizing to me but it may smell good to a dog.  But my Nicky didn't like the smell.  Left it in the dish until he must have been starving.  I kept trying to get him to eat it for two weeks and gave up.  It is too expensive to throw away half the time.  I am now trying another brand that
"While my dogs like this product, it isn't the best value. I can find it for less cost at two locations close to my house. I thought this would be cost-effective and convenient, but it isn't proving to be the case."
The food line is excellent however the texture is almost runny. Not very consient
"It was not a favorite. They took a few bites but did not really like it. I tried mixing it with a ""favorite"".....and they ate around it."
You would need two or three of these to make a decent meal for a medium sized dog.  Although ours liked it I feel it's just not sufficient to warrant the cost
Dog love Food I hate the dented cans also hate contact chewy to complain
"My Coton pups would not eat this no matter what. They are big fans of just about anything meat, but they took one sniff and walked away. They skipped a meal, which is rare. Highly disappointing because you have to buy a bunch of these all in the same flavor. Wasted my money for sure."
Once you know the process the service is good.  Food was delivered as promised but had a couple of dented cans.  I don't purchase any cans in the supermarket that are dented.  I have a choice to put it back on the shelf but when it is delivered not much I can do.  Please inspect and package so cans won't
"Yes, I recommend, but with reservations. Read the labels !!! Have fed this product to my 6 dogs for several years. Had read how very involved the original owner was ... having his name on ""quality"" food. Very disappointed that Dick Van Patten, the ""original"" owner of Natural Balance, sold out to a huge"
"Before you judge me, I didn't eat it. I just mean that I went from the potato duck to this to try something different for my dog. While she likes it and doesn't protest it's not as moist and its more solid than chunky making it hard to stir up with the dry food. That's really my only complaint. Chewy"
Been using Nurto adult savory lamb & rice recipe for years.  Currently 2 out of 3 of my puppies and 1 prior puppy have/had food allergies.  All could eat that food.  Since it has been reformated into kitchen classics I can't find a single canned food that all three can eat.
"Although this looks and smells pretty good to me, my little fur babies are just too spoiled. 
I usually buy a different brand for them - which they love- but was trying to find another less expensive variety for them.  I will just have to keep getting the other one we found here on Chewy!"
I did not realize that what I was purchasing was a real stew like product as I usually purchase the pate' style. I was not impressed at the amount of gravy included with this product. I add canned food to the dry food and usually can split a can into a couple of days feedings. That was difficult to do
"Too much jelly surrounding the meat in can, whereas other dog foods dont have all this jelly, I have to scrape off and throw out. Too pricy for all that extra jelly, but dogs like it."
"I have a senior dog, Smokey. Going on twelve years old. He's a big guy, my Smokey. Half Lab, half Newfie. I thought I would change his senior food up a bit with chicken and rice rather than the beef and rice senior from Pro-Plan. He was not enthusiastic about this. He likes beef. Yes, he will eat this"
"Our dog who needed Renal Support food, really liked this food for 8 days and then decided to not like it.  Now we're switching him to Royal Cannin, letter T.  As for the dry Pro Plan he did not lke it.  I think because he has some loose teeth and it was too hard to chew.  Two of our other dogs constantly"
"I liked your prices when I started but in a short time they went up by five or six dollars per item ... when you live on a small income it becomes tougher. Though I don't want to, I will have to look to see if I can find the same item for a few dollars cheaper or buy a less expensive brand."
I think it looks great and I know how good this product is helping our pets loose weight but non of my three dogs like it. I have to spruce up with regular food like Little Caesar and so out goes the diet aspect. Wish it would work. They don't care any longer for the regular Metabolic canned. Don't know
"Chihuahua & Yorkie just don't like it. We've tried other foods as well, but so farx. They only like Cezars."
"Recommending with reservations; this batch (case) of cans literally has liquid sloshing around in the can. It's not gravy-like at all, just watery.

That said, it agrees with my German Shepherd and he likes it. The water content may be a fluke; I've bought this product before (off and on since 2015"
"Well I've given it two shipments (10 cans each shipment). Neither of my dogs like it. It's mushy looking, off white color and doesn't smell good. So I guess that's why my dogs only eat it, when force to do so. I won't reorder again! I don't recommend it. I bought it because it said it help with gas and"
"My dog seemed to really enjoy eating the Purina Beyond Turkey and Green Bean Recipe. However, I noticed on the three occasions I fed it to him, it gave him loose stools. I am thinking the gravy is too rich for his tummy therefore, I have stopped feeding this to him. My dog is a small breed so maybe he"
I ordered two cases and when I went to feed my dogs I opened the can and it was all gravy and maybe two or three little chunks of meat.  I had to go buy different food at the pet store.
"My husky wouldn't eat it. When he saw it, he looks like he is going to throw up. Opened one can, rest is still sitting there."
My mom bought turkey and beef and I barely eat either of them. Paws down and her search continues.
"I bought this as it is grain free and hoping because it is venison, it wouldn't trigger my dog's allergies. 
They aren't real keen on eating it however. I will keep trying different grain free foods for them!"
"Must be different from the black/brown label cans, which the dogs loved, I can no longer find!"
Blackie hesitantly tried it a few times and then would not eat it at all. i am donating the rest of this to the local shelter
Ordering was easy and shipping was fast.  I know this is a good quality dog food but my 8 year old chawhennie HATES it.  I order a whole 24 cans based on a sister giving me some from her dog.  She refuses to even smell it and went 3 days without eating.  I have had to throw away 2 cans and have given
"We were running low on my collie's Chicken, Rice and Oatmeal recipe, and learned that there was an ingredient change. Despite Nutro telling us only one ingredient changed (from whole grain oatmeal to sweet potato), there was more than that and my dog isn't a fan. We've started transitioning to Merrick"
I guess its ok but my dog doesn't like it very much.
She will eat it but she doesn't finish it off she leaves about a tenth of it in her bowl and doesn't come back to get the rest.
"Had hoped Kali would like this food, but she is refusing to even taste the this brand of food!
Guess I will donate them to the Green Valley Animal League upon our return to Green Valley.
Guess we will start purchasing one (1) can at a time to determine what the little lady will eat and like"
We have been feeding one of our dogs this food ever sense our vet started carrying the mix. She has Cushings. Her gas make our eyes water. Her poop stinks. With this order we are mixing the JD and metabolic our selves. Within 2 days her poop and gas smell is back to normal.
My dogs refused to eat it. I even tried to trick them by mixing some hot dog in it. They carefully picked out the hot dog & wouldn't touch this food. I had to get rid of it. Waste of money.
Too big of can for me. This one is too heavy and it takes a good can opener to open. I like the pop tops better.
The high fat content kept my dog begging for food. Gaining weight. Not satisfying at all. We buy 3 cases per month and he has almost gone thru it all in half the time. We will be switching back to his Nutro Healthy next month. I do not recommend for older dogs.
My dog noticed the dented cans even before eating the food {HA HA]. 1 in each set of 6 cans was dented.
"I am giving this service a second chance, but if 8 of the cans from the twelve that I order are damaged, like this case I received, I will no longer be using this website."
"My dog seemed to like this for a minute, but then he turns his nose up at it now. It could be that he is just a picky eater...otherwise I love these products."
"Used to love this, as did my pups, but the formula had absolutely changed and it is awful. The pups don't even like it anymore. This used to have a good amount of gelatin but that had been replaced by pure fat.  This not only makes it like concrete if it has been in the fridge, it also makes it much "
"Previously the Merrick 96% Real Texas Beef was just chopped up beef in a can ...
now it's a pate, like a spreadable paste & my darlin' is disappointed ."
My dogs both love the Pure Essentials venison but don't seem to like this flavor.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with the food.  The dogs just don't care for it.
I think the product is very good. She does not like it to much
Have been buying Rachael Ray brand for over a year since we got our dog.  I even switched the cats over.  I was buying the variety pack of wet food to supplement his dry food.  I do the same for my cats.  He loves them so I bought some of the Chicken paw pie for the cats.  Great product.  So good that
"I think even dogs know the difference in regular foods and weight management foods. This is probably a good food but my dogs turn their noses up at it, that's the only reason I gave a 3 star rating. I do like the wellness brand though."
"My dog refuses to eat any of this food, wet or dry.  It must be horrible because she has always been a pig when it comes to food."
"My westies' don't particularly like this type of texture. They prefer solid. However, it is packed with peas and potatoes. if I feed it alone, they eat it better. I always mix the can food with their dry food."
"My dog who eats almost anything will not eat this at all. He's never refused to eat any dog food except this. I've tried everything I can think of to get him to eat it and he won't go near it. 

He does love Hill's Science Youthful Vitality canned food and the Mobility dry food but he gives me dirty"
I was hoping for a better reaction from Willow who is the one eating this food. Her reaction was somewhat tepid at best. I won't be buying it again. Not because I don't think it is good food (it looks good and it smells good) but because Willow did not really care for it.
"Yes my GSD is a finicky eater, she wouldn't eat her dry food so I tried canned food to mix it together, I had tried a different brand a more expensive brand she ate it for a while but turned her nose up after a while so nmow I'm giving her this brand and so far she loves it. I've tried the turkey and"
My dog likes this food occasionally.  It looks and smells desirable. Still searching for a home run
"Hello Chewy world!
If your dog needs baby food, this would be a good fit. 
My Toy Poodle would not eat it. The food is too creamy, mushy, but may not have been her choice of flavor, since this was the first time we had offered her lamb. It has a noticeably different smell and she just refused to try"
She loves this one. Ate the whole can and licked the bowl clean.
"My dogs didn't really go for this flavor. They picked at it and ate some of it, but there wasn't much enthusiasm, and they didn't want it again."
"My dog turned his nose up at this dog food, I expected a much better product for the price."
"The vet prescribed this food for my Jack Russell Terrier for his problem with prolonged loose stool.  I was skeptical that he would eat it only because he always has been a very picky eater, and we had no luck with him eating other prescription food.  Much to my surprise, he ate it.  For the first few"
"I gave this product 3 stars because my dogs have been on it their whole life and are very healthy.  Also, it is ""vet recommended"".  However, I cannot get past the consistency of this food.  It is more like a ""paste"" than anything else.  It is disgusting because it sticks to the spoon, sticks to my fingers"
"My dog has enjoyed this food, its healthy brand for her."
Royal doesn't have treats with low or no protein in it so I tried to make some out of the wet food but it is too wet so either come up with a treat or make the wet food a little dryer
"My Chihuahuas just won't eat this, even if mixed with a food they do like.  Sorry Pedigree!"
"My dog did not leave a trace of this food in her bowl at mealtime. My 3 star rating is based on the damaged cans. I'm not sure how the items are packaged at the warehouse but the damage did not occur during shipping. Every can, even the interior ones had significant dents. So much so that it was a challenge"
"This canned food is very good in that it contains no grain and is only made from meat and vegetables.  But like every other product that is ""healthy"" for you or your pets, it costs significantly more than the ""unhealthy"" products."
I have a dog allergic to most things. I put this on top of his grain free Duck dry food so that he will eat it.
"The dogs love this food. All three of them eat every bite, but the consistency of the food itself is a paws down for me. It's very thick and gummy, not like a meat based pate at all. It's very hard to incorporate into the dry food especially if you have arthritic hands. Seems like it has a very low moisture"
"Put my dog on the same amount of food, only replacing it with proplan diet and in 2 weeks he gained 1/2 lb  Will finish the case and see what happens"
"My puppy who eats about anything turned up his nose at this food. After 
I dipped my finger in to sample, it was tasteless."
"Latest shipment had several dented cans, but no visible damage to outer shipping carton. Also the packaging of the dry kibble is not Customer friendly. Hard to open and reseal...there are much better packaging methods available."
"Apparently Del Monte has changed their recipe for the natural balance beef food roll.  Whereas I was able to dice it before, the food roll is now too moist and sticks to my knife when trying to cut into it.  I wish they would have just continued with the recipe for the original roll."
Took a look and ran the other way he hates it  don't recommend for finicky eater
will search for a different food within science Hills diet
Bought a case. Dog did not like it. Then autoship sent another case 5 days ahead of shipping date so I could not cancel. Stuck with two cases. Gave to dog shelter.
My dog.loves it easy serve natural product rinse out and recycle
"to be honest i use this as backup food for the price it is cheaper to buy ground beef and bag of veggies, cook them and freeze the extras then it is to keep buying these cans."
"This seemed like a nutritious and tasty product, my dog tasted it, but.she will not eat it."
My dog tried it for a day and snubs it off now. I purchased it because they were out of my typical food. Bummed. I'm going to donate the rest of the case to a local pet adoption center.
"Neither one of my dogs liked this food, which is odd since all they have ever eaten is blue dog food. I would recommend buying one can before you order a case of it"
My Chihuahua's are very picky eaters.  They ate the Taste of the Wild dog food but only because they had no choice and waited until 10PM before they ate each day.  I think I'll have to purchase another brand and switch every other day.  I like Taste of the wild dog food for my Chihuahua's because this
"After having bought multiple cases of the wonderful Turkey & Green bean version of this, I bought a case of this Chicken & Sweet potato. The SMELL of the chicken version (despite LOOKING identical to the other), can only be described as the worst bad breath smell you can imagine. Opened multiple cans"
"I've been feeding my puppies Nutro lamb and rice puppy dry and wet food since they were 5 weeks old. I had always purchased the lamb and rice ""loaf"" vs chunks. I have recently switched them from puppy to adult formula, and tried the lamb and rice chunks. They have not been crazy about the switch. Going"
My dogs don't care for the Pedigree Choice Cuts........will not buy it again
"This is full of items that are bad for your dog. Wheat?, meat by product ( look up ""by product"" but not after you eat. Yuck."
My senior dog ate this for a few days then started refusing it.
"Dog likes it, but the smell was terrible. Made the whole house stink."
"I was rather disappointed in this stew brand. I opened the can and it was dark gray gravy not good looking at all. But Roxie is eating it as long as I mix it with something else . There is no veggies in the can . If you want people to buy your product please make so pets will like and eat, very disappointing"
My dog is sensitive to barley. Also ingredients not clearly marked.
Tried this and realize my dog doesn't like beef.  That's just like me.  Donation to a rescue group. Will not be ordering it again.
"Our little dog only has two teeth and therefore we buy canned food with gravy and mash it up. But we usually buy pedigree canned food and it has wheat and grains.
So I thought I would try Iams. But the meat was tougher to mash. The taste is OK and I am sure it is fine for our little dog. But I'll be"
Thought this would be great after reading reviews but the dog will leave it in the bowl all day after just one sniff. Eventually it is eaten if nothing else is given. No comparison to Evangers whole chicken thighs.
"I was surprised to see that this dog food is a paste rather than real chicken and vegetables as the other two options offer.  There is a beef and a tuna weight management dog food that actually doesn't look like dog food, but rather something a human could eat.  This chicken dog food is not like that"
"Bought 12 cans but my dog doesn't like them at all, in fact he's afraid of even coming near to this food -- he would hide away! I have no idea why! Donated 11 cans to the local animal hospital."
"This canned food comes out of the can like a block of cement, no joke! Then try to mix it, good luck! Horrible product."
My dog always hesitate eating this food.  Always have to mix with something else to get him to eat it.  It smells bland and very gelatin consistency. Hard for him to chew it.
My finicky chihuahua has been eating this occassionally. So it seemed a good food for the price.
This food is rated high with dog food watchers but it looks cheap and fake. It's beef but the meat and gravy are very pale.  My dogs ate it the first few days but was hesitant after that.
"While I was.sure she would love this new wet food , she said No!  I must admit she is very difficult to feed. I do no give her highness table food/scraps. So the search is on!"
"our first order had several (5) slightly bent cans
our second order had 4 slightly bent cans and 4 partly crushed cans
if this is the norm we will not want to reorder"
"I use Merrick canned food as toppings for kibble. My dogs eat this food, but more or less pick at it. They seem to enjoy the whole chicken wings in it, but not the other cubed pieces in the can. This food is mostly gravy. I wont purchase it again."
"My mistake I guess, from photo I thought I was buying loose meat in gravy but got congealed food instead. Dog eats it and seems to like it. Like ""human fast food"" I guess. I won't purchase that one again."
We love the wellness brand and the consistency of the food was good but my picky pups just turned their noses up to it.....
After raising 2 dogs exclusively on Hills when my dog was diagnosed with liver disease the choice was clear. I wish this very expensive prescription food was offered in sample size or smaller sizes. My dog wouldn't eat this unless smothered in something else not good for her restricted diet. The texture
My Boxer dogs are not to pleased with this food! I heard Blue Buffalo is a good food. My dogs are very picky eaters.
Half the cans were dented...a few pretty badly.  Dog doesn't seem to mind but was worried about her getting sick.
"Due to current product accessibility crisis, (and it is not the first one), I am in the process of switching brands.  What difference does it make if it is an excellent product not readily available?"
"Unfortunately this product did not win my dogs over. I have three rescues whom are senior dogs and they would barely touch it. I must admit the smell was just horrible and the first time I used it, I opened two cans to compare because I thought the first one had gone bad. Also, their feces is of a tar-like"
Just opened a can today - tiny little pieces of meat. I think I'll stick to what we purchased beforehand - Merrick - Big Chunky Steak Tips Dinner.  We really preferred the Evangers chunky meat but it was taken off the shelf.
As much as this cost it should have pop top cans. My dogs turned their noses up at it. It has great ingredients but something about it causes my dogs to rather do without.
I am not a newcomer to this food and I order 2 cases of this monthly. When I ordered my 2 cases they came as usual but this time 21 out of the 24 cans had mold in them. Chewy sent 2 replacement cases and 23 out of those 24 had mold on them. So out of 48 cans 44 had mold. I feed this to my senior dog 
"This flavor of food happens to be more of a pate while the other flavors are a chunky, looking like real food. i was disappointed when I opened the can after purchasing a case on the recommendation of the chewy salesperson. 

My dog still likes it but I was looking for a chunky, hearty type of canned"
"Our two Shih tzu puppies will eat this food but are not impressed with the odor. We mixed some cooked chicken bits with this food and it seemed to help. I will not buy this food again, however, am a Blue Diamond believer."
"Dogs like the product but I have been getting a slew of shorted cans, this one takes the cake.

This one only has 10.7 oz total (product + can)  that is supposed to have 12.5 oz of product minus the can in it."
"I can't really say if my kitty likes this because I use it to syringe feed when he won't eat. It has a more calories then most foods,is easy to prepare for syringe feelings and has quality ingredients.I don't understand why Hills insists on a doctor's prescription to buy it,I guess it's a marketing statagy"
"I have switched my dog to canned food because she quit eating. (She was eating Blue and Four Health Grain Free) I have tried several brands, trying to keep it interesting, and this one was not a fav. I also found a black spot in one of the cans and threw it away. The delivery of food from Chewy was just"
I think she smells the unfamiliar salmon and just walks away.
"My Cuddles did not really love this item... Normally I order Chicken and vegetables.  I don't think Cuddles really cares if she has vegetables, but the chicken and vegetable version comes in chunks and the chicken and barely version comes in a paste.  Cuddles normally sings for her dinner... Chicken "
Desperately trying to find a dog food with no chicken that my very picky dog will eat. Unfortunately this isn't one. Turned her nose up at her first bowl and refused it for the rest of the day. Good thing chewy has such a good return policy.
"Beneful Prepared Meals give my 2 small dogs diarrhea and I am glad I never purchased this product by the case.

It has a small amount of protein and a lot of salt. Looks tasty but not much nutritional bang for the buck.

If it were the only food my dogs would eat, I'd still consider other products"
"Not sure why my puppy doesn't want to eat this food, I was expecting a good reaction from him but he's not eating this unless he's really really hungry and if he tried it is just a little bit and that's it, he will not eat it again. kind of disappointed. Bad thing I bought a case of 12 and now I don't"
I honestly don't know how to rate this. With my first order they loved it. Now they turn their noses up and walk away!! Is it a bad batch or are they just too picky?
I wouldn't reorder it my dogs weren't that crazy for it
"Bought this because of reviews here. My 4 rescues hate it! They will eat it if I mix a little cheese with it, otherwise they ALL walk away from their bowls. Same with the Thanksgiving turkey flavor"
When I pay this much for a case of canned puppy I would not expect all but 2 of the cans to have big dents in them. Very disappointed with purchase. I am a 4 year customer and this is a first.
"The cans were all the flavors promised, but almost every single can was dented.  I would probably be willing to give them another chance, but the price increased so much after our first shipment that it is not worth it to order again.  It is cheaper to order from our local specialty store than to order"
"Sadly I thought it sounded great, my dogs refused to eat it. I do not know why they wouldn't. It smelled really good."
"My dog likes the recipe, however every order I have purchased, when I try to open the can it's easily bent and the lid becomes impossible to get off."
"I tried to give four stars, but it wouldn't let me. My dog loves this food; however, I order two cases of it and all but 4 cans are dented. We have fed her one case and they seem to be sealed, but I am not completely sure that their integrity has not been compromised."
was very oiley . I am not sure what is going on but even the 2 cases of the wilderness that I was sent to replace the oiley product was the same way. I can no longer order these products I will have to switch to something else. It is not just a little oil it is a lot. I have recommended chewy to several
After my dog eats this food he has a very foul body odor and he doesn't like the food. It stays in his bowl and will only eat it when very hungry. The odor is pretty bad. As soon as I stopped giving it to him he did not smell
I bought this Food to try something new. I normally but Purina Beyond Pate and my dogs never have any issues. I bought 4 cans and since my American Staffordshire Terrier and Olde English Bulldogge have been on this food; Kane my Staffy has woken up at about 2:30 am every morning with the case of the 
"Nothing special.  The dog eats it, but then she eats everything.  Its dog food, what do you expect"
Unfortunately I ordered 2 cases to find out my dog will not eat this wet food. She like the lil bits wet food from Merricks but steers clear of her dog bowls if I put this wet food in her bowl.
the cans of dog food were so severely dented (all of them) that I wouldn't even feed it to my dog. I emailed Chewy and usually the Customer Service is outstanding but I guess due to the hurricane if Florida they were unavailable. I threw all of the product away concerned my dog would be sick. Very disappointed
My dog actually loves the chicken and beef but won't eat the salmon. I wish they sold these separately rather than the variety pack. I like the packaging. little cans that are easy to open and perfect for one serving.
"My older dog is gaining weight for the first time in his 10 yrs. I thought I would try him on this product since they eat Pro Plan. He loves it! but doesn't seem to be good for weight loss. Maybe I should give it to him after he has lost the weight to help maintain it.
It also gives him horrific smelling"
My dogs eat it but act as though are bored with the taste. May have to change to another texture or gravy base.
"My almost 11 YO Standard Poodle is not driven by food to begin with though isn't what I would call a picky eater either (food is just not a driving force in her life), very slow eater and is now limited to a non beef, chicken, etc diet, (no grain always)--but is a very athletic active dog so needs to"
My dogs enjoy this product (they each get a spoonful per feeding with their dry food).  We try to avoid chicken products though...so I wish they could package a flavor assortment with no chicken.
Took some getting used to but now is on the menu. Will keep using mixed with other varieties.
This one and the chicken are the only ones without carageenan which is a bad ingredient due to cancer and other concerns. This food has huge chunks of beef in a rather awful looking gravy. What's not to like about beef? Too big of chunks even for my 70 pound dog and not very good smelling or consistency
"It is a decent product but like so many others, it is too pricey.  I have 7 personal dogs and 11 rescue dogs.  I like to feed them quality food but the prices are prohibitive.  It's kind of like anything Fat Free is more expensive, the same is true for Grain Free in pets.  I buy it periodically as a "
"Two of these cans were so badly dented (crushed, really) that I could not use them.   A simple inspection, even a glance at this case would have shown this, had anyone looked."
My dog likes it well enough but it's so hard and compact coming out of the fridge it's difficult and messy.  I prefer feeding time to be much easier.
We've heard good things about Blue Buffalo products and thought we'd give them a try.Good or bad I'll be back to report how the pooches did with this product.
Our toy poodle and mixed breed small rescue dog will not eat. Tried it for the first time and will not waste my money on it again. Will return to Wellness brand but wish they used the pop off lid.
"I'm sure this is an adequate dog food but I'm feeding it to a 12+
Rescue senior and after he eats he is bloated and gassy.
I am exploring more appropriate options."
"My two GSD'S are fussy
I have tried several brands
Of wet food and they just aren't 
Interested.  Same with the
Slop
Not sure if it was made
From 100 percent meat
Which it what I want"
"My dogs put their noses up and wouldn't go near it. It sat there for two days and then I threw it away.
I wish they had liked it but they didn't."
"Unfortunately my picky boy did not like this food. It has a pretty strong ""smoky"" smell to it so I'm wondering if that's what the issue was. Overall it seems to be a good quality food but it didn't work for us."
"the dogs do love the taste but it has a greyish color to it and is so very sticky and hard for them to swallow without adding water,almost gluey. Although I do recommend this canned food to others I also have to add my thoughts about the color being grey and the addition of water has to be added for "
Cans are almost equally split between alot of solid food and cans with little solid food and alot of gravy. Not optimal daily nutrition. My Chi needs low fat to avoid problems with possible pancreatitis in the future.
"My picky eater gobbled the last case down so I was thrilled to find something she liked. She's back to just looking at her bowl but her""condition"" is improving."
my dog hates this food she will not eat it what a waste of money i have a case here just sitting
"Good for gravy but means less solid content,  prefer solid cans of foods, give dog water for consumption of fluids.  I really like Chewy for home delivery.  (Wish FedEx could carry delivery in my house, rules say he cannot.  Heavy dry food bag and heavy cans-of-12 in a carton.)  In all, appreciate delivery"
This is a better product than some .. does have a named meat source in the first 4 ingredients which I very much like.. I only use it as a topper on my dogs food.
"Unfortunately my dog will not eat this food. She ate it for 2 days, and now it seems she would rather starve than eat it."
The worst quality of dog food you can imagine it is nothing but the worst parts of the animal you can think of on top of that the rest of it is just fillers not good quality at all I wouldn't recommend that to my worst enemy
"Thought this would be a good addition to the chicken stew and lamb stew which my dog's love, but unfortunately the beef had globs of fat mixed in with gravy. I ended up having to go through and get rid of the fat before feeding my 4 dog's."
"They were not crazy about it.six pets one ate some of it.
Keep trying new food as you can tell by my orders"
I had high hope for this can food due to the good reviews.  I purchased this for my senior dog that loves most all can food.  She doesn't like this one!!  I cannot get her to eat it.  My other two dogs don't care for it either.  I guess I will have to give away or donate...it was a waste of money.  This
This is a so-so food for my dogs.  They will eat it but are not excited about it.  I will likely try a different variety next time.  My dogs prefer a food with chunks of meat rather than a pate type of food.
"I bought this for my one and half years old GSD since it says it is good for sensitive stomach & skin. I opened it with high expectation and thought my dog would love it. However, it smells like a can of mesh potato and starch... No smell of salmon at all(does not look like the picture showed on the "
"My dog doesn't seem to care for it much, but will eat it if the cat doesn't eat it up first. lol"
My dog just was diagnosed with Diabetes and this brand of dog food was recommended.  I was thrilled with the price and with my dog's response to it
My dog liked half of the contents he would not eat the compressed meals but loved the wet ones like beef stew ect
"My dogs like the taste, but I don't care for the smell. It could be a little less pasty so it can mix better with the kibbles."
"As a basic inexpensive canned dog food, this is a good product. It has added fillers and parts of animals rather than chicken breasts and whatnot. I use it to feed my blue tongue Skinks, so it's a perfect diet for them. They need all of the whole animal parts. For my dogs, I would only feed this occasionally"
"Zucca has never been a picky eater, but i can tell she is not liking the flavor of this canned food. She was fine the first couple of weeks, she now leaves food on her plate or waits to eat it until she is really hungry and it's not because she is losing her appetite. I will probably try other brands"
Ranger really loves this stuff.  He eats the dry dog food but while I was in the hospital 2 weeks and then 2 more weeks the second time he stayed with a neighbor.  The neighbor let him eat cat food and table scraps.  So now I have to Dr up his dry dog food.  I bought this canned food to add to the dry
"My dog literally walks away and stays away from her food dish when I have tried feeding her this wet food, definitely will not purchase again!"
This is not the most healthy dog food available but my old dog likes it and he is a picky eater these days.  I supplement this food with high quality dry like Blue Buffalo and high quality supplements for joint pain and health
"I'm sure this is a quality canned food, but for what ever odd reason, both of my dogs (a Wheaton Terrier and a Black and Tan Coonhound) are both not eating any canned food at all. For years, I have mixed canned food with dry food without any problem.  Suddenly, they will not eat any canned food at all"
"My dog is very picky, so when the formula was changed on the Liver flavor we went to the original which took some time for him to adjust.  He did eat some with mostly treats on it in order to start the feeding process.  Now even if we put treats on it he won't touch it, and it's been like this for a "
"The wet food is very dry so I mix in a cup of water when I serve the can. The food is good, kind of reminds me of a dry meatball. My dogs aren't crazy about it, but they do finish their food just not as enthusiastically as with their regular food."
"My little dog has pancreatitis so he's on a low fat diet. He seems to be doing okay so far, but he's taking prednisone right now.The only thing that I don't like is the fact that the first ingredient listed is meat by products."
"I thought I would try a case to see if the price justified the purchase. Sad to say both of my dogs didn't see to like it at all. They are quite a diverse duo, both rescues. One is a Brittany Spaniel the other a large Terrier mix. They didn't eat very much of it at all, I ended up dumping most of it "
"we're testing my little guy for food allergies, which has severely limited food options.  He wouldn't touch the dry kibble until I added this canned food and mixed them together.  Then, he licked his bowl clean.  The only drawbacks are that I had to buy so many cans and that they are large cans which"
"My 4 year old Papillion sometimes eats the Pro Plan Chicken and Rice Canned by itself.....I feed him about 1/4 of a cup in the am and pm.  Then again, he is such a finicky eater, he will not eat this at all.   So, he does not get anything to eat either in the am if he does not eat, or in the evening."
"My doggy is a 10 year old long haired chihuahua who is EXTREMELY picky about his food. Generally, I have to either give him wet food with his dry food or just by itself and he will eat all of it up in seconds! That was not the case with this food unfortunately. I'm not sure if it was the texture or the"
I think something is wrong with this beef dinner. Cant hardley get it out of the can and is very hard. Would like another case of chicken dinner if I could. Dont know what to do with this. My dog wont even eat it. Do I have to return it in order to get another case of chicken dinner?
"I really like the convenience of Chewy, however when I order dog food and then I don't receive it until my neighbors bring it over 5 days later it really makes me wonder why Chewy is using Fed-X as their delivery contractors."
the smell was like a good stew. Some of the cans were like watery soup with not much solid chunks in it just watery. my dog liked it but it was sloppy and had to wash his face after. I went back to the other wd and mix some of the stew into it. just to sloppy alone.
This was prescribed by my vet but my dog won't eat it so I'm feeding it to my other dogs who will eat anything.
"Still trying to find a wet food that our dog will eat.  I'm sure this is very good food, but not for our picky eater."
Good product at a good price but the free shipping took 5 days!
"My dog would not eat it.  She is a Papillon and is finicky when it comes to dog food.  I would always buy a limited ingredient diet for my girl, but it's hard getting her to eat it.  She has never had ""wet"" dog food before, only kibble."
"I ordered this by mistake.  I usually order the Chophouse Ground dog food.  When you open this stuff, you find about 1/3 of the contents is the ""gravy.""  The remaining is chunks of food floating in it.  Unfortunately I ordered 2 cases.  I'll be certain never to order this again!"
"This is life saving food for my dog, and it's very convenient to be able to order it online and have it delivered instead of picking it up at the vet's office. However, this was my first time ordering and 3 of the 12 cans were dented. Two of them so severely I will not serve them to my dog because I "
My dog did not like two of the flavors.  Expensive and had to throw out quite a bit of it.
"I have 5 dogs. They are not particularly fussy and my Lab will inhale anything.
They all refused to touch this dog food.
I do not understand it.
They have never refused to eat.
I tried mixing it in with other dog food.
The Lab reluctantly ate that.
But the other four went hungry.
I could not recommend"
My dog don't like this I thought this was chunky meat cubes but they had an Alpo dog the food that was chunky with gravy that was very satisfying  if i had that one it would be great i think it was horsemeat  Alpo
Bought this to mix with a prescription dry food for my picky pup. He has arthritis in his hip from an accident and has refused all variations of supplements so we got a dry food that supplies what he needs but it's expensive and we're worried he wouldn't eat it. Got this in the mail before the dry food
"The 5th & 6th ingredients are pork by products and chicken by products. All 3 brands of prescription food include by products. My vet recommended prescription food to possibly prevent bladder stones, which is the only reason I purchased this knowing about the by products, but I'll be going back to my"
"I opened two cans. Both had an odd gel substance along the sides of the food. I tried to get most of it off but it didn't matter, my boys didn't want anything to do with the food. Luckily I only paid half price. Won't be buying this brand in chicken again. Also bought the lamb version and that at least"
"Comes out like a mushy pile.  Even if my dog hasn't eaten all day, she will take only a few bites and walk away.  We are throwing away half-eaten cans every day.  I will have to try something different.  Ingredients seem fine, but probably more sweet potato than anything else because my dog loves venison"
"I tried everything and finally cooked some chicken breast to mix in with the food to get her to eat it. She has diabetes, so she is on a restricted diet. It is frustrating enough to have to give her shots twice a day, without her not eating the food. How much insulin she gets depends upon how much food"
Since the Royal Canine Chihuahua was out of stock I had to try something.  My dogs are very picky and several other things I've tried they wouldn't eat.  They ate enough to get by but weren't thrilled. Glad Royal Canine is back.
"I have been ordering from Chewy exclusively for a while and have been more than satisfied This is the first time I have ordered this 15oz can ""ID Cicken Stew"" for intestines as I have been buying the smaller size cans from my vet.  The smaller size contemts was soft but firm. The cans I ordered from "
"My dogs didn't like this very much, they definitely prefer the wetter food, not cubes"
"I ordered this food since my vet recently recommended that I use it for my senior coonhound, Honey. I had bought the first case from my vet and thought I would give Chewy a try when I was almost ready for the second case. The cans are identical but the case from Chewy was a different consistency. The"
"Since Benji likes Turkey I thought he would gobble it up.  He didn't, which shocked me."
"My dog, Snoopy, only ate it a few times and then he turned his nose up and walked way after a few meals.  Now I have 22 cans of a food that I do not have any use for."
"We did our research online and overall this brand has a 4-5 Star Rating.  When the product first arrived and our Siberian Husky pup tried it, he seemed to love it...but then there was a sudden drastic change in his bowel movements to diarrhea.  We tried smaller servings mixed with his kibble, still diarrhea"
My Japanese Chin will only eat it once in a while. Expensive to throw out but I have to sometimes...
Didn't realize that this was pate. Dogs love it but me not so much. Will try something else
Buster eventually ate it but he wasn't a huge fan of it. The texture is pretty mushy and I add dino-vite powdered to his food which makes me have to stir it up even more and it ends up like a paste.
"THE PUPPY ATE IT AS A LAST RESORT BUT HE ATE IT, HE'S NOW BIG ENOUGH TO FIND SOME OLDER DOG FOOD TO FILL HIS BELLY"
"My dog does not like this flavor of Cesar's dog food at all. I thought she would love the Cesar's Meat Lasagna because I know how much she loves to eat cheese and I have given her small tastes of regular cheese lasagna. She hated it. And, since I bought a whole case of the food, now I will probably have"
My dog turns his nose up to this food. I have to mix treats in it just to get him to take a couple of bites. Guessing it tastes like tofu. Very disappointed. Hopefully the dogs at the shelter are hungry.
Hi my name is juanita i got my dog caser food she took one bite then she walked away i look down on caser food their was baby ants crawling everywhere my dog been sneezing alot and itching itake her baths but their still on her i clean mop everywhere and i keep seeing them on the floor crawling Dont 
"This was a not agreeable for my dogs digestion.
We decided to stop giving it to our dog. This was the only option or move and leave him here."
I was considering feeding this to my Dalmatian with food allergies and atopic dermatitis but Chewy's information doesn't match Solid Gold's. The ingredients are not the same and the calorie count is different.
"This used to be really good! This last batch was off color, and paste! The label now says ""salmon and liver""..we won't buy again with this formulation. Too bad, why mess with a recipe?"
"I have purchased the Funky Chicken Chicken Soup by Weruva a couple of times, and my dogs really liked it, so I thought I would try another flavor.  Unfortunately, this was nothing like the Funky Chicken!  The Funky Chicken was thick and filled with a substantial amount of meat, but the Peking Ducken "
"I sent a case of this food to my sons dog for Christmas. I live in Illinois and they live in Maryland. Adam said Bacon has never eaten better in his entire life. He doesnt get it every day - every other day or so, mixed with his dry food. Thank you!!!"
"My dog loves Chewy, he even knows the boxes when they
come to us super fast. He has tried about 25 middle to high
priced dog foods and has loved them all. But he wouldn't even
taste this one,  Duke does not recommend."
When I saw BB 27 Aug. 2017.  I was not happy. It is September now. and I bought it as a case.
Sadly my baby did not like it at all. He wouldn't even smell it twice. Therefore I would not buy again :/
My cat is a Bengal... for some reason he does not like this food..
"when solid gold changed the label-whitefish was added to ingredients. the calorie count went from 582 to 406! I noticed the texture is softer (more liquid) I still believe its quality food, but I have to find something with higher calories for my skinny girl."
"I was looking for a wet food my babies loved, but this was not it."
My dogs wouldn't touch it and I bought the turkey bacon and pork. I'll be donating this dog food to a shelter.
"MON. 10-2-2017   11:31 A.M.  I RATED THIS 1 STAR BECAUSE EVERY CAN HAD ONE SIDE OF SOLIDIFIED FAT---SO HARD I THOUGHT IT WAS PLASTIC (ALSO IN NEWMAN'S ORGANIC BEEF CANS).  I WILL NOT ORDER ANY NEWMAN'S DOG FOOD AGAIN.    I LOVE CHEWY.COM, THOUGH.    
THANKS,  CAT"
I have 2 dogs 1 is 6 and 1 is 5months. Both dogs do not care for this at all. Which is shocking since they love all the other flavors. They won't eat it at all. I donated the rest that I had to a shelter.
"I know this is an excellent product per the label, but my 6 month old puppy is not interested, so I would not purchase it again. I am mixing it with real, boiled chicken because I hate to throw it away and everyone I know who has dogs, don't feed canned to their dogs."
"I ordered the cow and duck. Our dog loved the cow, but wanted nothing to do with duck. Finicky?."
"Instead of a stew consistency, this food is made up of balls of beef sausage .  My dog seems to like it ok , I just expected it to be more stewy."
Agree with review below.  The formula changed and my dog does not like the food as much as before.  Color and consistency looks terrible as noted in the picture from a previous post.  I hope they go back to the old formula.
"Of the three flavors I ordered of Tiki Dog, this one is the stinkiest and the one that my dog doesn't eat immediately. (in 2.2 seconds) He likes it which is important, but I will not be re-ordering this flavor, because it is so smelly. Regardless of how much he likes it."
My dog will not eat it!!! I tried and tried. Sooooo disapointed.
"I have heard great reviews about this product. I had it for a foster dog last year and he loved it, but my own will not eat it. They are so picky and I have tried hundreds of brand name dog food. I feed the Chihuahua's on the horse who live behind me, otherwise, I would just be throwing money away. BTW"
"My Chihuahua turned up his nose on this one, refusing to eat it. He loves the other Weruva wet food, but this one got a ""paws down"" vote, I am sorry to say."
This food looked odd. It was oily almost like mineral oil was added but not mixed. None of my 4 cats would touch it and immediately walked away. I gave the rest of the cans to a friend who rescues dogs and she said the dogs liked it.
"I love the idea of this food... I really want to love this food. It's organic, it's sustainably vegan with a nice range of supplements, my dog seems to like it. It's just that, it's not user-friendly; it's entirely too dry in that it seems to fling out when I try spooning it out of the can. I had been"
My pups don't really enjoy this.  they will only eat this if I don't give them anything else.
"Fur baby Yorkie who normally very picky, ate it up, Fur baby Toy Fox Terrier sniffed it then wouldn't touch it, normally he will eat any kind of wet food.   It doesn't have a bad odor,  I won't be ordering it again."
"I got this due to the short ingredient list and the fact that goat is usually low in fat.  I've fed them goat products in the past and their raw goat food is one of their favorites.  They weren't crazy about this.  They will eat it, but they aren't overly excited  I also had a couple of dented cans in"
my dog did not like it at all I had to throw it out
My cat is sickly so we try to buy him the healthiest food but he is so picky he refuses to eat it.
My puppy loves this stuff but it gives him mucousy poo. I don't love the company. Ask them where they source vitamins and minerals from and they will tell you basically every continent in the world but for Africa. That means China. Rabbits are sourced from France ... At least that was the case when I
When I look at the ingredients listed on the can the first ingredient is venison broth. Chewy.com says it's venison meat. Also venison heart is absent from the can whereas chewy lists heart in the ingredients. Has the formula recently changed?
"The ingredients look fantastic. The problem is the packaging. Didn't even want to try feeding this to my cat after noticing very quickly that can after can after can shows signs of RUST.

Two paws down."
"I was very disappointed that the cans need to be opened with a can opener. Prior to this purchase, I was buying the cans at my local pet food store and the lids pulled off. I am not sure I will purchase from here again. I feel the description of the item should have mentioned the can lids not being able"
"Love the actual product, my dogs both seem to enjoy the taste and consistency of this food but sadly all the cans that were on outside corners of box came so dented that was almost impossible to even open cans"
"Evangers makes great dog food. However the cans were rusted, dented, and looked terrible. There were even mouse droppings on some of the lids. Unfortunately I will not be purchasing this food again due to this issue."
"My maltesse tea cup babies are very picky. The fact that for the first time EVER they eat it was such a relief. Maybe they just no not like lamb (like their mother). I will try next time the ""Itsy Bitsy Beef "" I will let you know how it goes."
"I was stunned that both of my dogs hated this food. They wouldn't even take a bite! My Chi just licked it once and walked away. Usually Halo is a bit hit, but not this flavor. Expensive fail for sure! Very disappointed they wouldn't even taste it."
Tried this food based on all of the great reviews. Opened the first can and there was a large glob of greenish slime in the can. Since it wasn't on the perimeter I'm unsure if it was fat around the edges or something else but based on the consistency I wasn't going to try to guess and threw the can away
"This food is a rich hearty stew with mostly meat and veggies, not so much gravy, unlike like the other stews we have tried. It does not smell bad! My dog loved it at first as a topper to his dry food, but refused to eat the second shipment we received. Not sure what changed but we have moved on to a "
"I have purchased Wild Calling canned food in the past and my dogs loved it. Great quality food. This is the first time purchasing pork flavor. The first case I received, the consistency was complete liquid. Chewy so graciously sent out a replacement case right away. That second case was almost as bad"
"The 'chunks' in this canned food seem a mystery - not obviously meat (the ingredients suggest chicken but???) but the vegetables are obvious. The cans are tightly packed, with a minimum of gravy (we add water to mix with dry food) and a seemingly tomato base, although this is not evident from the list"
Just a warning.  I think wild calling is changing some of its formulas.  My dog use to love the Turkey Trot.  Now with the latest batch she won't even try it.  She is not a picky eater at all.  The same thing happened with the Salmon formula in the past.  She still loves the Bison formula.  I hope they
"I was fooled. Technically it is chunky, but I was expecting whole muscle meat, which this is not. It is a ground product shaped into irregular size chunks, average 8 chunks per can. The rest is a gravy looking substance that my dog does enjoy. As for the ""Chunks"" he looks at them, then at me as to say"
"I was a bit concerned when I saw the 'look' of the food when I opened the first can, but it had been recommended on Dog Food Advisor. THEN shortly after I got the food I received a recall alter; not for the flavor I purchased but others in the product line. That's it for me; no more Evangers."
"Having read the other reviews for this product, in particular, and Weruva, in general, I really, REALLY wanted to like this canned dog food. But, the long and the short of it is that only one of my 2 dogs likes it, and I am just not wow-ed by this product.

I really like that Weruva makes their products"
I am sorry but the dog food smelled so bad my dog wouldn't eat it. My family had me open the second can different flavor outside and my dog would not eat it either. But some dogs may like it and dogs with extreme food allergies it is great for them. Just not my dog.
"None of my 3 dogs liked this product. 
It is a very moist pâte most suitable for mixing with kibble.

Two of them will eventually eat it but don't like it.
The third totally refuses to eat it and will choose to go hungry every time it is presented for a meal. I usually mix it with a beef kibble ("
"NOTE - there are only 6 cans in a case of this food at a similar price to the old 12-can case!!!  Also, there is a large amount of liquid in the can and a smaller loaf of food.  My fault for not noticing there were only 6 cans, but at over $25, I just assumed it was the old 12 cans.  This is an EXCESSIVE"
My dogs have this a mixed review.  Some were not interested to eat it.  No pup ate with relish.
Unfortunately my dog did not like this food at all. Texture and smell was not appealing. Expected better.
"Good ingredients, but the smell was awful and the dog barely touched it. Recently tried the Venison & Sweet Potato and she liked that. I'm kind of glad she doesn't like this one because of the smell :)"
"I'm sure this is a quality product with quality ingredients, but quality does not matter if your pup won't eat it."
"Along with 75% of the cans being dented in the 4 dozen we ordered, the food itself was pretty gross. My dog will eat anything, but the texture of this stuff was pretty sticky and nasty and hard to get out of the can. We'll see how our second order goes end if the quality is this low with both the food"
"This food is really runny, but it is a quality dog food."
"I bought this because I needed syringe-able food for my dog. He has a PEG tube. This food flows easily through the syringe, so that is good. But then I looked at the ingredients on the can. Loaded with animal by-products. you pay a lot of money for quality dog food and this is full of by-products. Its"
"Sophie's veterinarian said absolutely no food from Thailand-EVER. Oh, dear. Had already ordered a case so he said to feed a tablespoon with usual wet food (Merrick or Instinct) and watch closely. I guess the Coton de Tulear has good digestion because a small amount each day is fine, so will continue "
"I rotate brands, for every meal. This flavor contains Carragenan, therefor it is not rotated in very often."
"I'm giving 3 stars because Castor & Pollux makes a good product.  But my dogs didn't care for this flavor.  First - chunks are huge.  My dogs are 18 lbs, 35 lbs and 48 lbs, and these chunks are too big and they are hard to cut in half because they are slippery!  Have to use a knife and fork as you would"
"I was so excited to find another choice for my cat's dietary needs.  He absolutely loved it.  However, cats become finicky so quickly, and now he does not touch it.  

The manufacturer is a quality company, when it comes to cat food.  I spoke to the owner, and I was quite impressed when he called me"
My two pits always have blue buffalo wet food and always love it. Except when I bought this one for them they wouldn't hardly touch it!!! I dont know why but definitely wouldn't buy it again.
This food is very soft and our dogs really didn't like it.  Tried because of nutritional review and mixed with kibble to change consistency.  Two cans arrived bloated in the case (though not expired) and that concerned me on the quality.  I wouldn't order this again though it is likely a good food per
"This food was very palatable, puppies loved it. Having 8 wolfhound puppies it goes very quickly and is too expensive for me to feed, other than the initial case. Would probably be good for smaller puppies and litters."
"First INGREDIENT  IS CHICKEN  BROTH
SINCE WHEN DOES CHICKEN AND TURKEY MAKE LAMB
VERY DISAPPOINTED IN NUTRO"
The several cans I have opened so far have all contained large chunks of potato and little to no turkey. Alot of money for white potatoes in a can.
"This one is still a question, I think the pumpkin turned her off.  I will keep trying since we have a case of it but the jury is still out."
tanner my dog dosent really like that kind so its just sitting on my kitchen table in the same box it was sent in sorry
"I have ordered this in the past several times to great satisfaction. However, for some reason this was a really bad batch...half the package weight was gravy/liquid and the solid food was mushy not chunky. Very disappointing."
"The food looks like it could be for human consumption. My dogs are so fussy when it come to better dog food. The enjoy Iams can once in while, but I try to keep it very healthy for them. Weruva is a good brand, and my dogs like veggies. However I believe the veggie size in this can are to big for my "
"I thought my Buddy would like this since I normally bake fish filets for him and he devours them.  The consistency is sticky, gluey and he won't eat it."
"I cut the rolled dog food into small pieces and use it as a training reward. My dogs are eager to work for it but it is stickier than other formulas and after handing several pieces of the food I have to wipe my fingers clean. It also has a strong smoky aroma. For my use, it's too messy."
"Sorry, dog didn't like; just smelled it and walked away. I left it there for a little while just to see if he'd eventually go back to it but he wouldn't ever go near it."
"With ingredients like carageenen and caramel color, no thanks."
"While some dog foods have a more liquid consistency, this one has the worst kind of liquid composition. Frankly, it looks exactly like throw-up, or something a dog would vomit up after eating too much, or the wrong meal. But, what made it worse was the foul smell. Granted, a lot of dog foods are not "
"I have been feeding my shih-Tzu this flavor for the past 6 months due my little boy's stomach issues. When I ran out, I ordered two new cases (silly me). When I opened the first can of the new shipment, I spooned out over 5 tbsp. of pure oil!!!  It looks like pure mush, certainly not pate as advertised"
"I recently noticed a change in the Hoppy's Rabbit both smell & consistency! Smells like liquid smoke,and my dogs will not touch it! They used to love it! I contacted Wild Calling and they said they switched the manufacturer that makes it,and I understand fully due to the fact the old manufacturer (Evangers"
I hate to send a bad review but this has nothing to do with chewy.com. This is the nastieat smelling dog food i have ever come across. It smells like poop. I only opened 2 cans because the 2nd time neither of my dogs would touch it. Had to throw that feeding away. Maybe it's healthy but it stinks so 
"Old ingredients:

Lamb, Lamb Broth, Lamb Liver, Egg, Pea Protein, Chick Peas, Tapioca, Natural Flavor, Spinach, Apples, Flaxseed Oil, Olive Oil, Sea Salt, Tricalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Guar Gum, Herbs (Rosemary and Turmeric), Zinc Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement"
"First ingredient is broth, high in salt. Then keep reading, they add additional salt. If it wasn't for the salt content I'd buy it. All the other ingredients seem healthy & the price is great"
"My dog loves it but the pieces are way to big, I had to cut it up for my dog to be able to eat it. No where did I see vegetables."
"Unfortunately I had to order a case of this (salmon). It smells like potatoes, I doubt there is much actual salmon in this. Even mixing this in with his most favorite brand, he still would not go near it.
It would be cheaper and healthier to just buy human grade salmon than this stuff. Wish Chewy would"
"Ordered this Lamb Stew, dogs loved it. What I didn't like is it is 90% water/broth and about 10% or less of meat. As far as stew, didn't find any vegetables. I ended up dumping out the water and just giving the meat. One would think Evangers would not be so stingy with the meat considering the cost of"
"I have fed all canned versions of Lotus for the last few years( including this one) The last 2 cases have been incredibly watery!!In the past, it was thicker like the beef stew. My dog eats it but I feel a pricey food like this should be so devoid of solid parts.  I called Chewy and the phone rep was"
My dogs love this but you need a chisel to get it out of the can so I've stopped getting it . I don't understand why they can't add a little water . If it wasn't for that I'd give it 5 stars .
I bought this food because I have 2 cats with grain allergies. I also have a 14 lb dog. I thought this would be perfect for everyone. And I would only have to open 1 can a day. I dislike cans of cat food in the fridge. I also read other reviews and people say my cat won't eat this food or that . And 
"My puppy likes the salmon and absolutely loves the beef, liver, lamb food by Tiki, but strongly disliked this one."
"I had high hopes for the Liver canned food, since the Turkey canned food was such a hit and worked out well, but I am sorry to say the Liver product gave my German Shepherd such LOOSE bowels and I only used it as a food topper for their Arcana dry food. I was very disappointed with this product!"
I noticed the food had a strange odor when I opened the package. My dog refused to eat it. I actually tasted the chicken and it was horrible. It did not taste like chicken at all and had a rubbery texture to it. The vegetables also did not appear to be of good quality. I was expecting something a lot
"My dog kinda eats this, just half of the portions I usually give her.  The other half she walks away from and  I have to use a spoon and put it in her face to get her to eat it.  The turkey flavor though for this brand, my dog would gulp it down.  This flavor is chicken, you'd think they'd taste about"
"My dogs definitely do not seem to eat this as enthusiastically as they have eaten other canned foods in the past, or even their kibble, I also at least here on Chewy don't see peas mentioned in the ingredient list but there is definitely peas in the food when you dish it out"
"The can is mostly juice. Some peas and carrots in a broth with a big chunk of fish. I like to give my animals a variety of different high protein, no grain foods and this fit the bill. However, my Shepard snubbed it but my hound really liked it."
Two of my four dogs do not like this food. It looks like mush and smells like something dead. I am very disappointed with this purchase. I was hoping to switch to a healthier option but this is not it.
"It does not measure up to Royal Canaan venison at all, even on the can it says to be sure to feed with kibble because it has no nutritional value. I will be switching back to my original food as soon as it is available from now . Very disappointed"
"My dogs love this wet food, but they all began developing diarrhea issues after feeding for a few months. Removed the food for a while and their stool went back to normal. Tried feeding the Triumph chicken again and they had diarrhea again. My dogs are all different breed and age, and don't have health"
"The other flavors didn't seem to change but this one did. Calorie content and protein content plummeted. 2.5 stars on dog food advisor. Other flavors I still recommend. But yup, this used to look and smell like human food. Not anymore....."
"It's just chicken (parts, meat) and liver (label doesn't specify from what species). It contains no added vitamins, minerals, or carrageenan (horrible ingredient that causes inflammation which leads to a number of health ailments). 

I needed this food for my renal failure cat as it doesn't contain"
Chihuahua did not like this food. She is a picky eater at the moment.Gave the food to a dog shelter.
"My dog doesn't like it. When I put it to the dog bowl, my dog just smelt and gone. :("
This product had a nice ingredients list - I have been reading reviews. We are coming off of Royal Canin- they have not been consistent with their production lately. And the cost has increased- Paying 90+ dollars a month for 3 8lb-cats is a bit unreasonable. SO I thought this would be a possibility- 
My dogs don't like loaf foods and only ate this when sure nothing else was coming.  I will admit I have very picky dogs.  Food looked and smelled good tho.
Since I have only been using the product 3 weeks I can't say whether it is working yet or not. Based on the ingredients and feedback from others I am extremely hopeful! We are willing to do whatever we have to do to save our pet. Including cutting our grocery bill to be able to afford his food. The reason
"I have two 10lb dogs who normally eat a dry Blue Buffalo or Wellness Digestive Health. I bought this as a treat for winter on the cold nights, they loved it but for some reason they would both regurgitate just the potato pieces. I started sorting out the potatoes because I didn't want to waste the $4"
"Gave my dog diarrhea. Tried mixing it with rice. Then tried sweet potato. Still gave her the runs. I had read that others had the same problem, but tried it anyway."
Dog really doesn't like this particular recipe unless I add tasty toppings to it.  I opened one can that had a large air space in it.  Another can only weighed 6 oz ..I didn't bother opening it.  I have been buying Solid Gold brand and have been satisfied  in the past.  Still have most of the last case
"Rio will eat this, though not as enthusiastically as his other wet foods. Rio is also a large breed puppy, which means we can't overdo the calcium. Evanger's proudly states the minimum calcium, but I think the actual calcium is much much higher. Not only does Evanger's add calcium, they also include "
Tried all the other flavors and the consistency of the food is perfect but the duck flavor is 90 percent liquid won't get this flavor for my dogs again
"Golden retriever, Ak Bash puppy is 6 months old and food isn't exactly interesting to her. Therefore, I've tried every brand for large breed puppies. This one is definitely a no go no matter what I mix in it."
"Unfortunately, my cats didn't like the food. I may try other varieties, but this one was unsuccessful."
"I heard that Ziwi is very good brand and my dog love the treat.
So I decided to try this can food. 
OMG ! I am so surprised with the smell. To me it's smell like zoo 
or feces. I had contact to chewy customer service.thye did refund the money. Then I check the review what other buyer says about smell"
"Both of my dogs picked at this food. I have to say I was expecting ""shredded"" chicken and got more of a firm texture. That was disappointing. The food has a nice smell, but no takers.They took a few bites and left the biggest part of it behind. I won't be buying this again."
"I bought a case for my cats, which turned out poorly since they turned away from this food. I then gave the rest of the case to a friend who has a dog and the dog ate it right up."
"I have a 4 year old poo-chon. Who is very active and is at a very healthy weight. He gets a belly ache every now and then not often but that was my reasoning for trying grain free when I decided to switch his food. My dog is not a fussy eater what so ever. He eats Nutro for his dry dog food, he eats "
"I tried this food for its high kcal content. I have a dog who is very picky and we needed to get moe weight on him for the show ring. However, he preferred a Purina Pro Plan canned over this food. I guess you can't read a dog's mind,"
"All the Nature's Instinct Canned Foods contain this:
Ethylenediamine Dihydriodide
Sometimes listed as EDDI, it appears to be used as an iodine supplement. It may react with sulfates and release free iodine. Calcium Iodate (currently in many pet foods) is indicated as the most stable iodine supplement"
"I've bought four flavors of Evanger's food and my cats won't eat any of them. In fact, one cat will usually taste any food for the first time, but he won't even taste any of these.

The dog, on the other hand, will eat them, but he will eat most anything, so I don't know if he counts or not.

Too much fat. Do not understand why put so much fat inside? Will not buy any more and will switch back the previous can food.
"My Lab. has eaten this food for some time; it has helped with his digestive system, which has always been compromised, and his coat looks GREAT!

It might be good my dog is very picky.She at it for a almost two weeks now she won't touch it.
High quality ingredients that my dog will eat sometimes . Expensive food for your pet to not want to eat with vigor.
My babies only ate the centers. I will not be getting this.
My dog likes the other flovors but not this one so much.
"my dog is sensitive to certain foods. though this food did not make her throw up, she has diarrhea and can not adjust. we are unable to continue feeding this food to our dog because of her diarrhea."
"Received what appeared to be a well packaged case of cans; however, many of the cans were severely damaged. Interestingly Much of the damage was on the inside of the box as well as the periphery.  This suggests to me that the cans were damaged before packaging.  Extremely difficult to open with an electric"
These cans are unlike any I have bought at local feed store! Doesn't look like chicken looks like beef in both color and texture
"My dog just wont eat it. Wont even look at it. Also, when I open the can there seems to be so much solid fat at the top of the can. I have been removing this fat but its really bad for your dog. I hope everyone else is removing it. Well I wont be buying this again since my dog dont like it."
"This has been the best food!  However, as I seen someone say above something is going on.  The quality has been horrible!  Very liquid filled and definitely not the same product we used to get!"
"So watery that I had to ""drain"" before mixing with my dogs food. Now the duck is also watery. Bought my last case."
"I have been using Nutrisca dog food cans (all varieties) for many years. This last order of the Salmon and Chickpea Stew Recipe was not the same in consistency.
