0,"It is not as stew-y as I expected based on other brands of stews I have purchased. By that I mean there is really not a gravy like you would expect to see. That said, my girls LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!! I have a Yorkipoo and a Papipoo and they absolutely inhale their meals (4oz twice/day each). I do not have"
1,"I have two small, picky-eaters and had good luck with Taste of the Wild dry, decided to try
this as a ""gravy"" for their dry. Opened can, ears perked up, gobbled it right down! Success! Even though the vet said to keep them on one type of protein (my main is chicken), I see no reason not to spice up "
2,"My dogs are really finicky, but they lapped this stuff right up. Even when one of them gets in a mood to not eat, all I have to do is pick up one piece for them to eat and it's on! Most of the time, one of them tries to rush to the bowls so he or she can get both bowls before the other one notices!"
3,"I had tried another type and brand of this and the dogs (5 ) seemed to just be okay with it.  I thought this might be better...It turns out they LOVE it...I have one that is very picky and fussy about her food so I just call her and tell her that I have ""duck"" for  her...She eats with no problem and "
4,I have not tasted it myself but my Mastiff really seems to love it!
5,"This was our first time to order Purina One online and overall a good one. This is a high quality product which we have purchased in retail stores. We use three to four wet types of dog food along with our Natural Balance standard dry food and get good results with feedings. The only negative, there "
6,"My 2 dogs had no problem switching from their old dog food to this!  They LOVE it!  AND.....it is so much healthier for them as well. 
Their attention span has improved, more playful and their coats are healthier!  
The oldest, Frank the pug, is 7 and showed no interest in play any longer. Even my "
7,"My 150 lb ,10 yr old mastiff loves this canned food!! I combine a partial can with the same dry. I feel much better about it since it's lower in fat"
8,I give our dogs one tablespoon mixed with their Fromm heartland grain free dry food. They both gobble up their food faster and with much joy!
9,"I have wanted to try the Green Cow Tripe for a while as I have used many Solid Gold products over the years and am very satisfied with the results of them.  But I wasn't sure of ""tripe!""  It is a little smelly, but actually that makes the dogs love it even more.  I will for sure buy more of this."
10,My shih-tzu loves this food.  There are nice size pieces and enough gravy to stir in his dry kibble.  He has allergies to anything chicken so he has done well with this food.
11,My very picky puppy has had a hard time finding a food she likes enough to eat regularly. I had high hopes for this food because my older dog loves this brand but I guess puppy is just to picky.
12,"I have a very picky puppy, so I mix a little bit of this with her kibble, and she loves it! It's also great that it is meant for large breed puppies so she gets the nutrition she needs."
13,Perfect to add to dry Nutro Senior small nibbles. The small portion offered allows the container to serve a few meals to add flavor
14,"Our Golden puppy just stopped eating at 7 months old so we purchased this food to enhance his kibble in hopes he would then be eager to eat. He, once again, LOVED his food and mealtime! He's eating well now and thriving!!"
15,"On a recent trip to Oregon we left our dog's canned food at home.  We stopped in Waterville and they didn't carry the brand of dog food we were using.  We selected the Wild Calling Chicken Coop in a can and our dog loves it. Since we couldn't find it locally we purchased it
online from Chewy. They sent"
16,My dog loves this stuff! I only use a couple of spoon fulls in afternoon as a treat. But he gets so excited when he sees the container come out. He can barely sit still!
17,I needed to return a case of food as our new foster pup had to switch brands. I sent and email - within 15 I had the most amazing response. Chewy credited my card and told me to donate the case of food. Amazing customer service!
18,"These are a little expensive, but perfect for a holistic diet. My Welsh Corgi is on these, and he loves the meat. These are all ground, so keep that in mind when purchasing. They're firm enough to make little wet pill pockets out of, as well.

My vet recommended me this brand, especially if you're "
19,My dog loves loves the taste and I think it has really helped add oils to his dry coat
20,"Jake was getting tired of Turkey, Chicken Liver and Turkey Liver Formula but he loves the Turkey and Duck. We also tried Beef, Salmon, and lamb formulas and he likes them all. Would love to see Wellness back more variety packs so that I didn't have to store some of each flavor."
21,"It is pricey. Actually, I enjoyed the smell if you enjoy salmon."
22,"He was getting fussy with his current food, and is getting older so I wanted to get something for joints as well as grain free.  Tried it and he likes it!  It has small pieces in gravy which he seems to like better than the pate foods."
23,"After my puppies are weaned, I add a small amount of the Cesars Puppy to their dry kibble, they love it! Also I received my order promptly, everything was complete, no issues."
24,Good choice for my dogs with chicken allergy. Food has good amount of protein and lower in fat. We mix with dry salmon grain free kibble.
25,"All my guys (4 Labs) like it..Time will tell. The only thing I am concerned about is will Purina, who just purchased Merrick, change the recipe or use cheaper ingredients...if that happens then all bets are off."
26,My Jenny girl loves it all!!!!! She was switched to this food because she has IBS and perianal fistula. This food has helped a lot!! It has no preservatives or fillers. She now has solid healthy poop!!! I have read many reviews stating that Evangers canned food has a lot of fat but I have yet to feed
27,"My dog loves the food. He runs when I tell him that its time to eat. 
But the can itself was not thought through. There is a little ""ledge"" on the inside of the can. It is there when you open it. Problem with that is that it doesn't let the food slide out cleanly. Without this ledge the food would slide"
28,Have tried SO many different dog foods that would satisfy ALL my dogs.  This one fits the bill.  Tried a variety of flavors and so far they've all been hits!
29,"My picky chi all of a sudden started not to eat her Lotus wet dog food she's been eating for years. I took her to the vet and noticed she lost a significant amount of weight. Being only 3 point something lbs now and ribs sticking out skinny, I was desperate to I frantically went to Whole Foods one desperate"
30,"Poncho is 15 years old, a chihuahua with an attitude and few teeth, was fussy about his food til this meal came along.  He isn't fussy about his food, actually loves it.  Still has an attitude, but not about meals any longer.  Thanks for making this available; it is great!"
31,"Pet Food Direct told me about this food the day after the salesman went in and gave them all samples before he told them what it was.  She said it was good.
I was looking for another brand at the time to get away from the brand I was using that was horrible after a while.  Her description convinced "
32,"We have a rescued greyhound off the track in Florida.  He has ALWAYS been plagued with bad food allergies. Lots of diarrhea, gas, poor skin and coat condition. He did fair on Royal Canin prescription. Then we found Ultra holistic senior after he had a huge amount of dental work. This food is amazing."
33,"My dogs love it. I normally feed the dry kibbles, but when I go on vacation and leave the dogs at the kennel they do not eat and the kennel staff gets worried. So the canned is more appetizing to them and they will eat better when I am away. I also like it if I have to give any medication. Kibble or "
34,"We have been using Chewy for a few years and are very satisfied with the products, service and speedy delivery. Very easy to use and change orders if you so desire and free shipping. 
Thank you Chewy!"
35,My dog who is 12-1/2 yrs old was diagnosed as a diabetic 2+ years ago - I researched many different types of dog food and this one has healthy ingredients plus great taste that she loves.   She does not like dry dog food so that is why I use this brand of canned dog food
36,I feed my toy poodle puppy one heaping tablespoon wet mixed into about 1/4 cup dry lamb limited ingredient kibble.  She has this and water available to eat when she wants and usually finishes the bowl by the end of the day.  She is jumping around early in the morning to come out to the kitchen to eat
37,"My Cavachon puppy is kind of skinny and a picky eater. He would sometimes turn away from Virginia ham treats, premium canned tuna etc. When I presented this stuff he dived right in, and not just the first time, everytime. He loves it . I use it as a topping  to entice him to eat his regular food."
38,"My dog has chronic pancreatitis. I'm always looking for low fat or  relatively low fat foods that don't sacrifice protein that she will actually eat. She loves this! I love that it's organic. I do mix it with a dry, very low fat product. This food makes her dry food palatable and keeps her weight up."
39,"We feed NB, limited ingredient, exclusively to our 4 dogs.  3 FBD's and a Pug, including treats."
40,"Only eat one tsb of a morning mixed one tsb or canned white meat chicken, 1 tsb water soaked kibbles. This is a special breakfast only."
41,Our 17 year old poodle has many allegies and the potato and fish food agrees with her.
42,"I have a lab, GSD, & lab/pyrenees mix & all 3 love Eagle Pack foods.  I feed them the canned food once a week to change up the dry food routine.  They absolutely love all 4 flavors.  Thank you Eagle Pack for making a quality food at an affordable price."
43,I did some research on the top 10 canned foods for senior dogs a while back.  My dog is 16 years old and she had eaten dry dog food all her life but I decided it was time to put some canned food into her diet.   Eagle brand is an excellent quality food and my dog actually nags me that it's feeding time
44,"Bought this for my 5.5 lb puppy and she loves it.  She did not like; the canned food I had bought her before.  This actually looks like real stew, not dog food, and is very moist. Every evening I give her half of the package mixed with kibble, and it is gone within a couple of minutes."
45,Awesome service! Jessie loves the small breed wet line
46,"While my dogs seem to like the flavor, you need to be aware that there are bones in the food.  If you have older dogs, as I do, or they have chewing problems due to teeth being missing, you must break up the bones.  They do break very easily and do not splinter."
47,I am very pleased with the quality of Nature's Recipe food and only with Chewy carried more verities of the Senior or Adult canned dog food.
48,"Chicken & Rice  Delicate Dinner Bland food (with the Beagle); Now is Restricted Diet  Chicken & Rice Delicate Dinner  Canned Dog.  Personally, I prefer the Beagle and it matched the Dry dog food that I feed with this. The new label threw me off at first, and I thought I ordered the wrong food but after"
49,"I have 4 little dogs, all rescues. I feed them only Merrick foods...they love them and their coats are shiny, soft, and healthy. Great quality food!"
50,Mason loves this food ;) Thank you Chewy for always having the best of the best for my dog!
51,I own a German Shepherd and he has had an allergic reaction to most food that I have tried feeding to him. It causes him to itch like crazy. The poor guy was missing fur in places and was miserable. I switched him over to the Blue Buffalo Basics Limited Ingredient dry food for large breed dogs and he
52,This is an absolutely fantastic product. Serving this with a side of veggies guarantees my dogs are getting premium nutrition. It also saves me time & money not having to cook for them every other day.
53,"I add this to his dry food to give a little variety and he absolutely loves it.  However, I thought I'd show you what he did to the box when it came from Chewy today.  I just tell him his food has arrived and he's trying to tear it open!  He KNOWS the good stuff is in there and he's happy!"
54,My dogs love this food - they are a little picky - but not with this brand and this flavor!!!  And you know with Chewy - the cost is great!!!!
55,"I only buy Wellness, but usually just the dry food.  I have two Dobermans 5 and 7 years old and my older dog I think was just getting board with her usual.  So, for a treat I got the can food.  Oh my, they acted like pups again, even whined and cried and jumped up and down for the food to be served.  "
56,"It has chunks in gravy, no strong fishy smell, my hubby and I hate fish and I guess our ""kids"" take after us, they weren't real fond of it but they would eat it. I think it is a good product."
57,My German Shepherd and Miniature Schnauzer do seem to like this food.  I mix it with a high quality dry and top it with the Hunk of Beef which almost always gets their attention.  I will order one more case because of this.  The only problem I have with it is there seems to be more gravy than beef.  
58,"Our dog, Luke, just LOVES the chicken thigh and bone. No problem with getting him to eat and it makes us happy because of it being grain-free! We're going to try another kind, maybe  the vegetable beef, so he has some variety in his meals.
Thanks from happy dog owners and their sweet coon hound!"
59,"My 24-lb terrier mix loves this food - she has had chicken, turkey, turkey/bacon. We buy the grain-free variety and mix it in with her dry food. No stomach upset, licks her bowl clean, very happy dog."
60,"Have used Tripett for years and the dogs start panting and pacing as soon as the can is opened, can't control themselves once they smell it. You'll feel so good serving this because it's absolutely pure and healthy plus it's a nutritious compliment to their diet."
61,"I usually cook for my dogs, but when the pooches need a quick dinner, the limited ingredient stew is a wonderful alternative.  I trust Merrick.  I don't trust many other dog food brands.  The pooches like the taste, too."
62,"This pate mixes up great with dry kibble.  The dogs all seem to like it, and it is Canidae quality you can count on."
63,I have been feeding my almost three year old Shih Tsu Cesar since she was a year old. Cesar is the only wet food she eats. Pate with Turkey is her favorite. She also likes Rosemary Chicken and Pork Tenderloin. I came to Chewy out of desperation to find my dog her favorites and I am here to congratulate
64,"got this food because of high calorie count- 524 To replace Natures Variety @556 that was discontinued.. MIGHT be a little TOO rich in flavor. 1 dog won't eat whole can @ a time-she NEEDS the calories, tho. SEEMS like good food from a good company. I emailed them previously & THEY EMAILED ME BACK :)"
65,"The chicken was a bit more spongy than the Duck I tried first but, this is NOT a watery product!  If you think your going to shake/pour this stuff out of the can...forget it!  It's nice & firm.  You will need a spoon/fork to get the product out of the can.  I like it when the product is more firm...."
66,"We've been trying to find a good food to replace a brand we used to use that changed their formula. Gave this a try and our doxie loves it. It's a pate, but doesn't get overly hard in the fridge, which is nice. It's organic with only healthy ingredients, which is very important to us, and best of all"
67,"My veterinarian wanted me to feed my Golden Retriever Innova Evo grain free beef dog food in connection with dealing with a major health issue.  My Golden Retriever loves the flavor of this wet dog food and gobbles it down.  However, the wet dog food by itself is rather mushy and what you might call "
68,My dogs loved the flavor even my cat chimed in while they were eating and had some.  I love all Weruva products and I see a difference in my dogs with the grain free.  They truly look forward to eating now.
69,"I have always provided the best nutrition for my dogs knowing that it saves vet bills in the future if they are fed well.  Both my dogs like the lamb taste of Blue Buffalo.  They eat other kinds of dry food, but Blue Buffalo is their current favorite wet food."
70,"Rocky is on a limited ingredient diet due to being recently diagnosed with Cushing's.

I mix this canned food with a bit of Greek yogurt into the kibble, and he gobbles it down.

His overall health is much better than it has been in some time.  I am very pleased with the quality of Canidae pet food"
71,"My wife and I took in a special needs beagle puppy (6 weeks old) that someone tossed in a swamp this summer. We came to find out she was born without an butt hole (wont let me use the proper medical word) and was pooping out of her lady parts, needless to say we had a hard time finding food that would"
72,I will be buying Blue dog food for now on for my dogs.
73,"Been feeding my 10 year old shepherd/heeler mix Eukanuba dry food for a few years. She has developed an allergy to chicken so had to change her food. Vet recommended dog food made with rabbit or kangaroo!! Found out it's super expensive. Decided to try Nature's Recipe with salmon, sweet potato and pumpkin"
74,I have two dogs.  They both gobble this food.  I feel good about feeding it to them because of the high quality ingredients; plus Halo has never been recalled as far I can tell.  My only reason for not giving it five stars is I would prefer it was grain free.
75,"If you're looking for a pure, clean, grain-free and minimal ingredients canned dog food, Evanger's Beef is the best.  Our dogs love it and we love that there are only four ingredients -- beef, water, liver and guar gum (thickener).  No preservatives, fillers or anything else you can't even pronounce "
76,"Our senior dog, Myrtle, stopped eating the quality dry food she loved for years, and we switched to this flavor of soft, Wellness food. Although I usually have to coax her to eat with all sorts of treats (I'll do almost anything at this point), she eats this with no prodding. We are 100% satisfied, and"
77,My dogs love this food.  I was in contact with EVO and was informed that they have/are discontinued there canned dog foods.  They will continue with the dry.  Of course it is in stores and will be sold until depleted.  I am surching for a differebt brand.  This was a 5 star on Dog Food Advisor.
78,As a service dog Zeus spends a lot of time on the road with me. Cans are not convienent for a day trip. Plus this size is perfect when testing out if he is going to eat a flavor or not without dealing with a big case of cans. Overall Blue Buffalo Basics Limited ingredients is a great food for a small
79,As usual my boys both clean their bowls enthusiastically! They LOVE this Venison beef formula. I like that the meat chunks are big so I can break them up and get a couple of meals out of one can. There are also fresh veggies that are visible and lots of gravy so it's a great kibble mixer!
80,"I first tried this food on a whim.  My toy poodle is very picky when it comes to eating and normally she will not go anywhere near wet dog food.  But lo and behold, she absolutely loves this food.  I don't know what it is about this food but it is as though this food was made exclusively for her breed"
81,"I normally feed her Newman's own Chicken with Brown rice, but mix it up with other Newman's Own flavors.  My dog really loves the Beef and Liver.  The consistency is a bit more loose than the others.  It mixes well with the dry food."
82,"Sophie is on dry food and often does not eat much because she does not feel well.  I have found that if I mix about 1/6 can of the Pedigree in with her dry food, she tends to eat better."
83,"I add a little warm water to it to get some gravy since it doesn't have any. We also mix it with some dry kibble. They ate it right up. My one dog has bad allergies, both seasonal and chicken, turkey, beef, fish, sweet potatoes and the list goes on so I thought this would be good for her. Still new to"
84,"I have a beagle that will eat ANYTHING and a chi mix that is maddeningly picky. She sniffs the bowls and walks away while the beagle is eating like I never feed her. I mix a small amount with kibble with the beagle, and the Chi mix can't wait til I put her food down now. It's on the expensive side, but"
85,"My dog's favorite brand , in a breakfast flavor.  nice amount in container-1 per meal works great."
86,"I've been an auto customer for two years and love it. Fast, dependable service and always a great selection of food and supplies. My fur kids are happy!"
87,"Have fed Sunny Nutro Lamb and Rice premium loaf canned food for years.  When I saw the lamb and vegetables premium loaf, thought we would try it.  He absolutely loves it and it doesn't have the stinky smell that the lamb and rice has.  Happy dog!"
88,My dogs absolutely love this entree.  They eat it so fast so they must really like the taste.
89,"My dog has a long list of allergies and has been on hypo-allergenic food for years. Recently, his food was discontinued and my vet recommended that I try this brand. I bought the wet food because he can only have white fish and sweet potatoes and it is a hit! He loves the food! I combine it with a dry"
90,"I have 2 German Shepherds.  One of them has had a very sensitive stomach, and Eukanuba dog food causes her less intestinal distress than other dog foods.  I get my dog food from Chewy because of their service.  Local large pet store chains are often out of inventory, they are more expensive, and I have"
91,"My little pom dog was recently diagnosed with early CHF, which can be controlled for now on a ""Senior Diet"".  He loved moist/wet entrees at mealtimes, and when I started him on Purina Pro Plan, he just gulped it up!  I can tell this is one of his favorites, now!  He is so happy at mealtimes, and is acting"
92,"I have two dogs that must eat low-protein, low-phosphorous diets to keep urinalysis numbers in check.  We feed a base of real oats, fruits & vegetables with a rotating protein in controlled amounts (all 'real' food that we actually cook).  But on days where the supply runs out and I don't have the time"
93,Our dog loves this flavor. We also have to give our dog medication twice daily. The size of the chunks of turkey makes it easy to hid the pills. Much easier than peanut butter or pockets.
94,"Evangers is exactly what the can says.
This and Evangers dry kibble (chicken with sweet potato) keeps Oreo healthy and NO MORE bad digestive issues"
95,"Finally, a winner!  My chihuahua-terrier mix is extremely picky. I mix this wet food with her kibble and she practically inhales it."
96,"My little dog loves this food!  The brauts are approx 1/2 inch balls in a light gravy with other veggies. My senior Rattie has teeth issues, so the chunks are too big for her to manage on her own, but I mash it up and she chows down. I tried a few cans out from the the local pet store to make sure she"
97,"I LOVE THIS FOOD!!!!, real chunks of carrots, peas and potatos, He eats it right up, we mix this .25 to .75 with the chicken soup dry food and his coat is shiny he looks healthy and the vet said he is doing good, since he is a boston he still has gas (it will never go away) but this has definitely helped"
98,"The older my dog gets, the more her anxiety takes a toll on her stomach. As a result, I've transitioned her to a limited ingredient option. I supplement the Wellness options with some cooked quinoa (a high-quality grain) and organic turkey and chicken breast. As a result, her digestive issues have gone"
99,My Dog looks forward to her meals! Thank you for ptompt service and great prices.
100,"Maggie loves this stuff!  It is great as a topping for her hard food.  Some reviewers seem disappointed by the contents of the can, which I could see, but I was looking for a stew/gravy topping for Maggie's hard food and this is great for us!  The bones are an added treat.  At first I was concerned but"
101,"every time I have a new foster come in I feed wellness simple and have never had any kind of digestive upsets with the dogs. After they have been here for a week or so I switch to Wellness simple kibble because it is less expensive to feed long term. Every dog I have fostered, young or old, has done "
102,"I mix half a container with half a cup dry food for my puppy (golden retriever) and she absolutely loves it! It doesn't look like your typical ""compressed cat food"", it has healthy looking chunks of meat and there are peas with a little bit of juices. Made in USA and ingredients are phenomenal. No brainer"
103,I cut this into bite size pieces and use them as training treats.  I have used them for my last two puppies and I am currently using them for my new puppy.   They have all absolutely loved them.   It is easier to get their attention when I have these treats. Since it is actually dog food it is better
104,"My two dogs love the Petites. They both weigh under 25 pounds. I just wish they were a bit bigger. I love the food has vegs (carrots, red peppers give is a sweet smell/taste), but not too much. This really appeals flavor wise to my dogs."
105,All 5 of my dogs love Weruva Dog Food.  We have tried every flavor and I have not been disappointed.  It looks good enough to eat.  I have tried many different kinds of dog food and this one beats them all.  The quality of the ingredients are what I love the best.
106,"This is one of the only CARRAGEENAN free products on the market. Banned in human grade food, it has nearly been banned in pet food multiple times. My pup licks her bowl clean now- she used to eat half of her food and leave the rest to snack on hours later."
107,"I have a picky eater, but he LOVES this.  The Chihuahua was out of stock so I got Dachshund.  He loved that as well.
My Chewy deliveries get here so quickly.  So much easier than going store to store collecting food, treats, toys..."
108,mix it in with buffalo dry food 2x/day for our large doggie
109,"Many canned pet foods are dense and sticky like this food. Because I like to use canned food as an appetizer/treat on top of the kibble and to add supplements to, I would prefer something wetter and easier to mix, even out of the fridge. But the pup inhales it."
110,"I bought this for my mini dachshunds based on a review on Dog Food Advisor with 5 star rating.  I am sure this excellent dog food. I am trying different wet food.
This is one.  It may be to much for my dachshunds.  Time will tell.  For sure a bigger dog would have to like it."
111,Meat based canned foods are rarer than I knew.  Great food with a good percentage of actual meat
112,Excellent cuts and appearance/ smell. We use this as a tasty topper her and there just to mix up the proteins. One of the few Wellness Core canned foods that does not contain chicken or poultry (read all labels on other varieties very carefully). Excellent! Highly recommend!
113,"My 18 month Golden Retriever and Labradoodle both love this food we mix it with the kibble. The doodle had quit eating a food for allergy sensitivity as well as stomach sensitivity, I only have to mix a tablespoon of the canned with the kibble and she gobbles it down. This makes the canned food last "
114,Wanted a wet food with pumpkin to help with digestion and the two terriers love it. One tray is enough to feed both of them. Very convenient.  I had a problem with one tray that had leaked and smelled but Chewy sent me a whole case to replace. Great customer service!!
115,We get this wet food on auto delivery and switch up our kind each time. They love a scoop with their kibble!
116,I HAVE 2 DOGS. A BICHON AND A SHITZU. THEY ARE BOTH FINICKY EATERS. I'VE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL BRANDS OF DOG FOOD ( DRY & WET MIXED. JUST DRY IS IGNORED. ) THE DOGS WOULD ONLY EAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF WHAT WAS OFFERED AND LEAVE THE REST. DUE TO ALLERGIES TO THE CHICKEN AND BEEF  MIXES MY VET HAD ME SWITCH
117,This food was recently not in stock at the local pet store in my town.  I was disappointed because this is what we give my 15 1/2 year old Jack Russell to ensure he gets the nutrients he needs.
118,"My male Samoyed, 10 years old, has had his liver compromised.  He is on the  Royale Canine Hepatic diet and I have to be super vigilant that nothing he eats has copper in it.  So I am reading labels for the ingredients and I have switched to supplementing with the Evanger pure Cooked Chicken because "
119,I have a very finicky Akita that can be a problem at meal time. He loves this as well as the turkey and the duck flavors. Doesn't care too much for the salmon or the beef though. We add 1/8 - 1/4 can to his kibble.
120,"All 3 of my babies love Wellness's turkey stew! It has the right ratio of fat to protein for them and gentle on the tummy (not too rich). It does have a little too much gravy, but I don't add all of it to their bowls. Add a little warm water, mash with a fork (for the little ones) and dinner is served"
121,"My chihuahuas love the Earthborn products that I've purchased so far (dry food & the moist), and with Chewy, it's delivered straight to my door quickly - perfect!"
122,"My two rescue dogs, each of whom has severe food allergies, love this product.  They get half can and then kibble later.  It does not smell bad like other venison/duck products, and there are real veggies.  Sometimes they like to just lick off the gravy and then come back later for the rest."
123,"My pit mix has to be on a very LID due to severe food allergies. While she has had no issues with the turkey flavor, she gobbles up the salmon flavor. I have already changed my next autoship to the salmon flavor."
124,My lab mix has allergies.  Chicken is a known to trigger allergies and the Instinct Rabbit has no chicken products in it as well as no grains.  Instinct makes a great product.  Many other dog foods will say Rabbit etc and if you read the ingredients  there is always chicken stuck in there food!
125,If your cat needs extra fluid I highly recommend this. While my cat does not like the beef one he does like the chicken and he needs the extra fluid. The carton states to the discard it after 7 days which I find to be okay since my cat almost finishes the carton within the time frame. I have added it
126,"I have three small dogs; an 11 month Toy Australian Shepherd and 2 senior English toy spaniels.
I have been using a small amount of senior canned food in their Solid Gold wee bites all life stages dry food.
I recently purchased CANIDAE all life stages canned food to mix in. I am so glad  I finally "
127,"The lamb and beef have small bite size squares, just the right size for my shih-tzu.  He loves this food and once again no chicken or byproduct so he does well with this food and his allergies."
128,My dogs love it and I make dog treats out of it. I have made them and given to friends that have dogs and they love the treats I make with it too!
129,Smells good enough to serve for Thanksgiving! Even the cats want it! AND auto-delivery was WONDERFUL!!!
130,My dog soon to be 8yrs old is a really picky shih tzu. Cesar is the only dog food he will eat. Buying from Chewy has so many varieties and so much cheaper than buying from Pet Smart. Love the fast shipping and love having delivered right to my door. Thanks Chewy
131,"My dogs are not puppies, but they do enjoy these very much!  I give it to them in between their dry food feedings and they love it.  Shop with chewy and you get your orders very fast and also at the best price!"
132,Food is expensive however my little senior dog loves it.
133,"I have a senior dog going through medical issues.  I can put her meds  in this food and she licks the bowl clean. The food smells good the ingredients are simple and healthy.  It's a good product. 
Chewy is amazing.  Two day delivery for a good price. I'm sticking with them."
134,I am a big fan of the Weruva wet food products and was getting the cans before switching over to these food pouches. This has the same quality as the cans but more of a pate form. I really like this because its more convenient for my small dog as one can normally lasts for multiple days and requires 
135,"This puppy food was recommended by our vet for our 8-month old puppy, and he loves it.  I am confident in serving it to him knowing that I am giving him food to keep him healthy.  Purina is a great brand."
136,"I originally found out about this product from a dog trainner.  My dogs would be looking at her hand and being obedient.  Since then,  it's a no brainer. I either give it to them as a slice and let them work at it or I cut it up in pieces.  Also, I put meds in a piece and it has never been discovered"
137,"We have two Shih Tzu mix dogs.  It is a bit of a challenge finding a food that they both love.  But the first time they ate this, they both cleaned their bowls in record time!  I love the consistency.  It's not big chunks, but it's not the typical pate that is a hard blob.  This slides out of the can"
138,"I feed my 13 yr old BC/Lab nothing but Blue Buffalo. I supplement with a glucosamine/ omega 3 powder...and other than some arthritis in his spine, he's a very healthy boy. I put about 1/3 of a can of wet with a hearty scoop of dry and Blue Buffalo has so many great wet food choices that I'm able to vary"
139,Unbelieveable!!!  Corky just devours this dog food.  So glad I found it as I was having difficulty getting him to eat the Filet Mignon and Porterhouse Steak ones.  He is 13 and has lost most of his teeth so cannot chew much of anything.  Thanks so much.
140,I would like to cancel this order - my dog isn't eating it as good as she did so I'm choosing the chunky stew wet food to see ig she eats that one.
141,"My dog is allergic to chicken and byproducts. This food is one of the few without chicken. The store where I was getting it wasn't stocking it. I found it on Chewey, ordered it, got it promptly, price was better than in store and no shipping charges. Everybody's very happy!!"
142,My 14 1/2 year old little guy loves this food.  I finally had to take him off hard kibble and put him on canned food.  He wasn't wanting to eat his kibble so I switched to this. I'm sure it's his teeth.  Now he gets canned in the morning and kibble that has soaked in water overnight at dinner - doesn't
143,"My dogs are very picky and if they don't like something, they go on hunger strike. I've tried various expensive foods and they turned they nose up at all of it. I ended up giving it all to a homeless man with a dog. When I got Natures Valley Instinct Beef flavor my dogs had no problem gobbling it up."
144,We feed our dogs the Blue Buffalo dry food line and supplement with a small amount of the Family Favorites line of canned food.  Because of it being like any other stew it is easy to remove small amounts and mix it in with the dry food.  Our dogs love both products.
145,"My Patsy seems to only like dog food that are in this consistency, she is a bit fussy, so glad that there are 3 or 4 varieties that she likes in the Wellness. Chewy's is great, arrives fast and don't have to worry about if the Petstore has it, since they don't carry this in the grocery store."
146,What can I say? The food is mostly turkey and looks good enough for me to eat. My dog loves it. I mix it with dry food twice a day.
147,"I had been cooking my own dog food for my 2 GSDs in crock pots.
When I found this Nutro Ultra I was pleased. It contains all the same ingredients I used in my homemade food. As does the dry Nutro . I mix the two together and my dogs eat it up. So much easier on me than 4 crock pots of food cooking at"
148,"We have always topped our dog's dry food with a little something extra but usually ended up rotating options to keep the dogs interested. Both our grain free, 50lb am staff and our not grain free, 25lb cairn terrier love this salmon topper and have been eating it consistently for weeks now! Both of their"
149,"The chi/beagle is fussy!  Trying to find the right combo of canned foods and kibble has been trying, but I think this one is a keeper.  Although she gets more excited about the ""Wingaling"" dinner, she still is pretty enthused by the chicken thigh stew.  It was a bit disconcerting, at first, to see whole"
150,The beagle I've been caring for has been on a rice and egg diet. He always had loose stool. I bought some of this food for him for hurricane Irma and he LOVES it! And has proper stool!
151,We thought switching our girl Lulu from Merrick's Backcountry Grain Free can food to the Merrick Limited Ingredient Grain Free would be an issue but she loves the Turkey and the Duck just fine. We love the Merrick products because of the quality but also because of the variety! More flavors equals lack
152,My cats can only eat salmon and trout. They are allergic to everything else. My local store stopped carrying this product so I am grateful that Chewy.com carries it! Many local rescues here use Evanger's Salmon for their initially rescued dogs and cats because it is such a high quality product.
153,"I been feeding this brand to our 8 year old Dachshund for years...I take a spoonful, mix with grain free dry food and water and he loves it!!!  The best part, he goes to the bathroom very healthy!!!  That is when you know your feeding them good food!!!!!!"
154,"First time our very cautious, hardheaded girl ate a meal without hesitation, without waiting for enticements, without a very calculating holdout for something better."
155,"Usually, whenever puppies are fed wet food in general sometimes they have liquid poop but this wet food sets the bar for all wet food. After working at SPCA, I have seen the difference wet food can do when added to dry food for a pup or adult dog, Zignature you are awesome! Not once did my puppy have"
156,"I have a senior dog that is on medication twice per day. I have to use different things to give him pills as he is a little picky. ;) I use this pate to give him his pills and he LOVES it! The consistency is easy to hide the pills especially when chillled in the fridge! The ingredients are great, so "
157,Had to find a natural fish based food with reasonable number of calories per can that my Chihuahua would like.  This one has 70 calories less per can and than the Blue Basic version of fish. She loves this food   And seems more satisfied after each meal. I just bought 24 more cans. Price is very good
158,My dog is doing well on this food. Have been unable to reorder but not Chewy's problem. Shipping was great.
159,I got the devastating news that my baby girl Lilly has heart issues. I was told that she would need to be on a special low sodium diet. I found this product and she loves it. She eats it right up. I'm very thankful I found this food and I know it's good for her.
160,Want to thank you for the great food for our dog. She loves it. Also it was shipped very fast. I love dealing with your company.....so does our dog.
161,my dog would not eat anything until he was absolutely starving. this could take a day or two! not any more. he absolutely LOVES Cesar dry and wet food.
162,"My fur baby has food sensitivities and Nutro Lumited Ingredient is the food he tolerates best. I checked out Chewy, found it was cheaper and delivered to my home! The order came on time...."
163,I bought the Rabbit Stew because my 2 terrier mix dogs hunt rabbits in our hay field when I take them out there. They are also great at hunting rodents that come in from harvest time in the fields next door. I use the Rabbit Stew as a topping for the Merrick dry food and they love it!
164,Mixes well with there dry food. Sometimes some cans sort of stink like the Chicken was about to go bad. Other than that they really like it.
165,"Geyser thoroughly licks the bowl then returns to make sure he didn't miss a morsel of Core salmon-whitefish-herring formula. Geyser gobbles up Core turkey-chicken formula but is even more enthusiastic about the salmon-whitefish-herring formula. 
I first purchased Core grain free turkey-chicken canned"
166,I started out by buying the variety pack a couple of times to see if my Doberman would like this food.  She devours it and she's a picky eater.  I like how there are real chunks of meat or poultry in every serving.  I blend in 1/2 a tub with her kibble.  Sometimes I shred up some fresh spring mix greens
167,"I split this between two 12 pound terriers for breakfast. They love and so do I, because it is easy and good ingredients for my teenager doggies!"
168,My KiWi & CoCo love Cesar & now the dry food as well. They are being cared for by a pet groomer as I heal & she has 2 dogs as well so I buy for all 4 & she tells me they are all happy campers!
169,"The two pup's I rescued were about 4 weeks old when I found them. I got lucky because a friend suggested the Nutro line. I then did some research, and read TONS of reviews, then promptly placed my order. My fur babies love it! I would not hesitate for a second, to recommend Nutro to my friends and family"
170,Switched to these dog food rolls recently as I finally got tired of cooking chicken on a weekly basis for the last 11 years. She likes the texture and I like less mess and work. Also know she is getting more nutrients. Also eats moe kibble with this food.
171,My very picky pooch loves this stuff. She used to pick her food from her bowl and eat it on the rug. Now she eats it all up on her plate. We add the dry duck kibble with the duck stew and so far so good.
172,"I tried this brand dog food when my regular dog food  I  purchase with potato and venison  has been out of stock now for months 
 My three dogs love it  they can't get enough of it even looks better and smells better than the previous brand dog food I was purchasing 
 I highly recommend this food"
173,"We had a very sick 10 year old dog.  She vomited every day for over a month.  The vet gave us some canned food for dietary upset, but she hated it.  So after doing some research we decided to feed her Blue Buffalo Fish & Sweet Potato and she is now back to her old self.  If your dog has digestive issues"
174,"Lily loves this food.  I'm not sure she taste it because she cleans the plate so fast. 
l give it to her in the morning and call it  'breakfast'.  If she ever turns it down I will know she is sick and take her to the vet."
175,Honestly it looked like a homemade stew but my puppy would not eat it? He didn't like it alone or mixed with his puppy food.
176,My dog loves this food and prefers it to another organic brand. I feed him Newmans Organic wet food in addition to a homemade dog food. It's on auto ship so I always have some on hand.
177,I ordered a case and 8 of the cans were dented. I dont think it happened in shipping because a few of the cans were in the center of the packaging and even the cans on the side were protected during shipping with brown paper packed in the box.Is it possible to get credit for those shipped damaged as 
178,Yoda likes the Hill's Prescription diet canned food.  For some reason she didn't take to the Hill's Prescription kibble; think it was the size which was about double the Buffalo Blue she was so used to having.  Two other dogs on the kibble also like the canned.  Read the ingredients on the can and noticed
179,I had been having difficulties finding a soft or hard food that my puppy would eat. She definitely loves her soft Royal Canin puppy food. She is a small breed dog and can almost eat the whole can!
180,My Vet suggested I use the prescription version of this canned food. I can't afford it so I decided to try this food. Both of my dogs love it. They devour it like it's a steak dinner :-) It looks just like the chunky sirloin steak soup from Campbell's. It smells like it too. I highly recommend it.
181,"I ordered the zignature because it has no chicken. My dogs loved It! I was cooking up Perdue chicken and putting that over their dry orijen and also adding the broth. I did research on can foods, and found this one to be excellent quality. My dogs really love it. I guess they got sick of chicken. So "
182,"This food is amazing.  My dog loves it and it doesn't bother his sensitive system.  He transitioned very easily on to it.  It will definitely remain in our rotation.  Thank you for the wonderful service, Chewy, as I had tried another flavor and my dog didn't much care for it, so I was able to swap it"
183,"Both of my dogs loved this food. I have 2 very different girls, with very different tastes, but they both really enjoyed this flavor. I'm thrilled to find something that they love, and that agrees with them. No sick tummies. I do agree, it's very difficult to get the lids off, but it's worth the trouble"
184,He is a toothless dog that I just rescued from a high kill shelter. This food was highly recommended to me sadly he is allergic to chicken so we found another food without chicken that he also likes. Excellent service with Chewy. I am donating what I didn't use to a rescue group
185,My 2 dogs do not eat well except for this. They are healthy no upset stomach. They never get tired of it and its auto shipped and saved money.
186,"This wet food was quickly gobbled up by my dogs.  One can feeds my two small dogs for one meal, and the cans are super easy and convenient to bring along for trips.  The quality isn't that great, but is good for a treat meal every now and then.  We'll probably buy more in the future!"
187,Our pup seems to be allergic to chicken protein. Imagine my dismay to find her food labeled lamb has chicken as a first ingredient. So far this food lives up to its name and her tummy and we are grateful.
188,This is a great food.  It is healthy and doesn't have a lot of fillers and does have real chicken and lamb!  Even though I didn't purchase enough for free shipping I received my shipment in only a few days!
189,"My dogs thrive well on Wellness canned Turkey, and it is great to have it delivered on a timely basis!     It costs less to have it shipped than it would if I drove to the store to buy it, and I don't have to load the car and unload the car when I get home.  I also save on using the gasoline to drive"
190,"I will definitely order this again & again!! My 4 furbabies (3 Boston Terriers & 1 little terrier mix) get dry food with a heaping spoonful of wet for breakfast & dinner (dry only at lunch). They LOVE this food! The first time hubby opened one, he thought he'd opened a can of human food by mistake. LOL"
191,My latest change to my 5 yr old Chihuahua's diet - Hill's Perfect Weight - seems to be very tasteful to her and I use the directions on the can to keep her weight under control.
192,"I've bought earthborn wet food for my dogs once before and they loved it, but im a little concerned that there's not enough meat in them. Dogs need protein and are natural carnivores, but only the turkey earthborn states it actually has meat in it. I will be doing more research on this type of food before"
193,My boys love this food and I love that it just takes about one tablespoon to coat their kibble. They get some moisture and a flavor they love and I can be happy it won't add weight to them since such a small amount is used.
194,We purchased this food to add to our dogs dry food.  She really looks forward to eating.  We feel confident that she will get the best nutritious meal since it is made by Blue.
195,Love Chewy.com   I have rescue beagles and they love all the varieties of Evanger's wet food.  I like that they are grain free and don't have a lot of chemical junk in them!
196,"Our 3 month old Aussie devoured, but our 3 month old GSD turned her nose at it, but licked off the gravy. Big chicken chunks in gravy and veggies too. Such quality ingredients. If your puppy likes a chunky gravy type of food, this is the one. I will order it again for my Aussie."
197,"So, when I cracked the first can open, I felt like I was back on the farm again, but more like someone had bottled all the farm smells up into one and I bought it! PEW!!!! This stuff smells like stinky farm butt; however my dog loves it and if she is happy and healthy, I am overjoyed. When I put it in"
198,My puppy loves this food.  I only add a quarter of a can to her Blue puppy kibble.  Only minor complaint - two of the cans came with a big dent.  I am sure this is a result of shipping and not from Chewy.  Customer Service at Chewy is outstanding.
199,"We have a picky Great Pyrenees (Charlemagne, known as Charlie) who undereats and is quite skinny that we re-adopted from my parents after they couldn't take care of him anymore. My parents swore he wouldn't eat fish, but I've found he's more adventurous when he sees our Pyr mix enthusiastically eating"
200,my dogs run to the kitchen when I open a can.  they appear to enjoy it.
201,"Our dog recently had a case of pancreatitis and we were told to put her on a low fat diet, to help her recover. She refused to eat the prescription low fat dog food which is supposed to help this condition. I talked to the Tech Service person at Evanger's who said this Vegetarian Dinner was formulated"
202,"I gave this 5 stars, but I have a VERY fussy hound who will not touch it, no matter what I add to it, i.e. canned cat food, ground beef, chicken. However, my Lab, who does not have kidney problems gobbles it right down. Have decided the hound's quality of life is worth more than her quantity, so am feeding"
203,"Our lab mix ""Dixie"" has a ravenous appetite and cutting down on her regular food was met with displeasure and constant begging and whining.  During her last routine visit at the vet, she tipped the scale at 120 lbs. and the vet prescribed a diet of Royal Canin Veterinary Diet dry food and wet food mixed"
204,"Finally! A food that my two elderly shih tzus love. It's not as messy as some canned foods. And because the cans are smaller, each can is a meal. After just a few weeks their coats are less dry and their stool is far less potent. Win win win!"
205,"I use this product for training.  She is not my dog. . .my neighbor's dog.  I have been teaching to to walk with me, and not tear out my arm.  She gets a tiny bite of it every time she looks at me.  This keeps her very interested in me and my pace, etc.  She is much easier to control with this product"
206,"I love having this food delivered right to my home. Saves me a trip to the pet store. My dogs love this, and it's grain free, which is also nice. I haven't had a dog who didn't like this food. It's also easy to digest."
207,I feed my dog some canned food with his dry food.  I have tried several different kinds.  I tried Purina One and he really loved it!   I trust Purina products for my dog.
208,"This food is good . My puppy is getting older now and sometimes likes the food with the gravy to change off. As long as it's blue, it's good . They have so many varieties at chewy and they're cheaper."
209,"My dog Annie Laurie's Vet at The Hope Center put Annie on Royal Canin Veterinary Diet - Selected Protein Adult PW canned dog food.  My dog has Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD), along with occasional bouts of pancreatitis.  Annie absolutely loves her new Royal Canin dog food.  She's licks her food bowl clean"
210,My dog has been eating this brand (Earthborn) for some time and I just wanted to try something different. I purchased 1 container at a local pet shop to see if she liked it. Wow did she ever. I now mix her dinner with half stew and half dry kibble. I have since purchased a case from Chewy.
211,"i have four very picky eaters and have been plowing my way through canned/wet foods that they will eat and that i can hide their pills in. this one has been a semi-finalist but i still plan to try other foods. variety is the spice of life - if we don't like eating the same thing every meal every day,"
212,Your service was a 10 good job I have already recommend it to several friends. I plan on ordering from you guys always. Products was delivered on time and well packaged also. I am very happy with my purchse
213,"My Puppy is only 2 1/2 pounds and she loves this mixed with her kibbles.  So to the ones that say their puppies don't like it try mixing it with kibbles, I use my fingers to make sure it covers her kibbles so not a lot ok... let me know if this helps."
214,I rescued a senior yorkie who was skin and bones. He had every tooth removed and is an extremely picky eater. Most food he walks away from. Someone recommended Merrick puppy food as a high calorie alternative and he LOVES it! I even see him filling out a bit. He was on death's door before I started giving
215,"My dogs LOVE this food, but I ordered the Beef and Rice WITH GRAVY but received the pate pasty kind which they don't like as well and is very hard to mix up with their hard food."
216,My 10 year old labrador was recently diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. She was loosing her outer coat and it was not as shiny as it once was. Our vets recommended a hydrolyzed food or novel protein. Looking at the hydrolyzed food I had little trust in the companies that make it so I set out 
217,"My girls, twin Shih Tzus 17 months old, absolutely LOVE the Duck and Turkey canned food! I put about a teaspoon on top of their Canidae dry food and mix it in. They are very picky and very spoiled, expecting  a little canned food mixed in with their dry food. I feed ONLY Canidae which they love and are"
218,Merrick food has been great for the dogs and chewy.com makes it so easy to order. Keep up the great work
219,"We went through a lot of food before finding one that our dog would really enjoy. She likes a few of the WeRuva flavors since it's basically feeding her people grade food that doesn't even look or smell like dog food, but she absolutely loves the streak frites! Wish the cost was the same as the other"
220,My puggle loves this wet food. I gave him a bowl for the first time and he gobbled it up and wanted more! Good dog food to mix with dry food to.
221,Our dogs favorite food - he does prefer the Chicken & Liver or the Duck - we like the ease of opening container and can reseal.
222,This is a great grain free canned dog food.  I feed a quarter of the can to my miniature schnauzer after he eats his dry food.  It's like a treat to him and he loves it!
223,This food is impossible to find stocked on shelves.  Chewy saves me time and with auto ship I save money and never have to remember to reorder!
224,My dog has a very sensitive stomach & this is the only brand so far that agrees with him.  I believe in non gmo & organic & this food is neither.  Anyway to change that so I can be assured he is being fed a healthy diet?
225,"Purchased this canned food for my 12 year old white german shepherd.  She has always had food allergies and intolerances and for the last 4 to 5 years can only tolerate salmon.  Just recently, she has become intollerant of Taste of the Wild Salmon, which she loved, but the only thing I can detect in "
226,"Our 13yrs old Jack Chi. Cha Cha, just loves this and the Senior Wilderness.  We also, get the dry version for her.  She was a rescue dog from a puppy mill and not in good shape at first and her teeth were awful, she had to have 8 pulled immediately, some had already fallen out.  She was 8yrs when we "
227,Your staff is wonderful! Bella was to eating this food and she did until we went on the food alone. She wouldn't touch it. Doc said put her back on her regular food. So I was sitting with 18 cans left and what to do with them. Your staff reimbursed the difference and told me to donate the rest. I really
228,"The ingredients look like they are very good and the brand is a good brand.  However my elderly dog is getting very picky about her food.  She will eat this eventually, but even though she has lost quite a few teeth she seems to prefer dry food over canned anymore, but I do think this is a good quality"
229,"My Golden Doodle loves it when I order from Chewy.com.  It's like he knows when the UPS man comes ringing the doorbell, it's something special for him from Chewy!  I ordered a case of Merrick Limited Ingredient Turkey and a case of the Lamb and he loves both products!   I ordered it around 10:30 on Thursday"
230,"My Picky toy poodle, is not a ""foodie"", so I had to do alot of experimenting trying different foods.  She doesn't like ""stew types"", but more of a pate.   She loves 
Royal Canin, but I had to find others for variety.    She likes Bella, which has a nice variety."
231,Heera has been enjoying this stew for almost 7years now!! Our beagle's coat still shines as a newborn's and we attribute that fact to Nature's Recipe Healthy Skin stew!! Heera has always been a vegetarian and we are very grateful for this particular brand for providing first choice!!
232,"This actually appears to be real food....chunks of chicken, veggies you can actually see and gravy. I mix with kibble and my blue heeler loves it."
233,My greyhound husky mix loves this! Like that it's chucky and you can see the veggies! Great ingredients!
234,"My little pug Josie, who has very few teeth left LOVES this food. She starts barking at me as soon as it is feeding time bc she is so impatient and LOVES this food. And she gets VERY upset and growly at the other dogs if they try to move in on her bowl, baring her couple of teeth she has left :) she "
235,My dog is absolutely so picky when it comes to meal times. We've tried about 10 different kinds and she would just leave it in the bowl. Since we switched her to this she eats it all up in minutes!! It is so nice to see her enjoying meal times and gives me peace of mind. Wish that there was more to the
236,"After a bout of pancreatitis, I have been struggling with finding something my dog will eat minus boiling her potatoes each day.  She isn't fond of the dry food she is so this is a great addition to her bowl!"
237,"This is my first time buying a rabbit dog food.  I smelled fine to me, and the dogs apparently thought it smelled pleasantly aromatic.   Wish it were a bit less expensive, so will buy it more as a treat than a regular food to mix in with the veggies I cook for the dogs.  The first time I gave it to them"
238,"I had received some of this can food from a rescue who did not have any dogs that needed it so they knew I had one dog eating Renal Support food.  I alternated this food with the D formula.  Guess my little senior bud liked it so much that when I ran out of T and was only giving him the D, he started"
239,Blue has been leading the way for so long with holistic great foods for pets. This wet food is just another fantastic example. Thanks so much for making it so my dog has something he can eat. Has no egg product or grains that he is allergic to and Lamb that he can actually eat for now. We struggle so
240,"Our Aussie Doodle Bailey made the transition from Chicken Soup for the Soul Puppy formula to Adult very easily. As far as Bailey was concerned, same great taste and flavor! Bailey lives for Chewy packages. When he sees the Chewy box, he knows it holds something great for him! Try it, your dog will love"
241,Awesome!!! I needed for fast and it was delivered quickly. I absolutely love the auto ship option. I never have to worry about running out of food for my baby
242,"My two spoiled baby's love this this food. My older poodle Vida has problems with her tummy, but she loves this food and she has no problems. My Aussi Pandora can be picky. She also loves this food and gobbles it right up .Vida is a toy poodle and my aussi is standard. I give this food to my older poodle"
243,"I bought these to use as topping for my dog's dry food and it works great. It looks like beef not chicken (darker than I thought chicken should be), but Maggy likes it. I use 1/2 per serving which leaves 1/2 to have to put in a bowl for the refrigerator. It would be better for me if it could be closed"
244,My only problem is that so many cases of my order were stuffed into the box and many of the cans were dented and/or crushed but still usable. Hopefully this will not happen again.
245,"My chihuahua love this food and will hardly eat anything else. The large pet box stores here charge almost double what Chewy charges, so now I order auto ship. Also, many times the pet stores were sold out of it and I would have to buy something else. Naturally my dog wouldn't eat something else so I"
246,My 5 dogs love this food. Pedigree is a brand I trust for my dogs.  I have used this food for a number of years and find it to be one food the dogs are excited to get. Best  part is Chewy has this particular food cheaper than even the stores and it comes right to my front door.
247,I changed my  order and the process was quick and easy and my order came through as promised without a hitch. Chewy.com is the best!
248,"This is our Shih Tzu's prescribed food from our vet for her urinary issues. So thankful to be able to get a carton from Chewy at a savings of about .50 cents per can, plus we live a distance from the vet and love that Chewy can deliver in a short time and right to our door."
249,"The salmon BENEFUL dinner is very hard to find in the grocery store & my dogs love it a lot.  It is a great last-minute dinner for them when I'm running late for feeding time, and don't have enough of their regular food on hand."
250,"I have a one-year old Cocker Spaniel which I fed the Wellness Puppy can to and she did great.

So, one can't have fat and the other needs fat.  One can't have protein and the other needs protein.  It is a battle with ALL foods.  But"

260,"As soon as the can is opened I can feel two sets of eyes staring at me.
Each dog gets half of a can mixed with half can of dry Blue  Buffalo so
they get the best of both worlds . I rotate 3 or 4 different types and brands
of top shelf foods and the dogs seem to like the  occasional change ."

They enjoy it and"
270,"Chewy.com was out of the Ultra Senior, the rep checked and found that the Adult Large Breed was very similiar to the Senior so I ordered a case.  The rep did not charge me shipping. The only thing that could have made it 100% is because they were out of Senior perhaps they could have substituted an item"

290,"This food is great! It smells amazing, like you were cooking a stew of some sort on the stove. My puppy would rarely eat, or at least we had a hard time getting her to, but when we added this to her food she couldnt wait to eat, as soon as she heard the food being poured she was ready. We have a little"
291,"My dogs have been on a metabolic weight management diet for a few months and they were not fond of it, so with their doctors  approval I changed their diet to the light food. The food is so moist there is no comparison. It is  so much easier to mix this can food with their dry food any day."
292,"Using Rachel Ray dry food for both our small and large dogs, but they're spoiled I admit, and they always want something 'good' mixed in for flavor....so now I'm using this, and it lasts for 2-3 meals!

294,My little 13 year old sheltie girl with kidney and liver problems loved this until the day she died. It kept her physical wasting to a minimum.  Sadly age and a stroke took her but seeing her appetite remain in contrast to her two older brothers with KD was a real gift.

308,I cannot believe how much time and physical lifting I saved. The food is about the same price as at the store but I did not have the hassle of finding enough food to last and I did not miss hauling the food to the car then into the house. All around this is the smartest move I could have made. My German

310,My crew love sweet potatoes so are up for anything that has them in it. I feed grain free to all 8 of my dogs because some do have allergies and sometimes they eat each other's food. This soft food works for the older dogs that have a harder time chewing kibble without making their bowel movements too
311,"I buy this product to help get the pills down. Four of my dogs require medication.  I have found that by hiding their medication in a small (meatball) of wet food, they take their pills first then continue with their kibble.  My Rottweiler is finicky and she prefers Pro Plan Grain Free to other wet food"
312,I have been vegan for 11 months and had no plans to transition my dogs. They all have varying food sensitivities.

Which I will mention with a RX dog food you even took out the guessing game for the Vets information by adding the zip code and vet's name and up came"
314,"I use this good as a topping on weight management hard food. It has meat and chunks of vegetables as well as just enough gravy to keep it moist so you are not paying for gravy.

I would not use this as their only food, it's too rich and expensive. One tub holds 8 oz's. I feed 3 dogs 3 meals, or a table"

No problems with the sensitive stomach."

317,"My dog's trainer cuts this up and uses it as treats and the dogs go crazy for it! You need to keep it refrigerated but I usually just cube it up, put it in tupperware, and pull it out for training sessions.

324,One of two of my beagles had stopped eating his dog food.  I ordered this and the adult healthy dry also.  And both of my beagles gulped it down with wagging tales.  They both have more pep in their walks and run to the kitchen for meal time.  Love this stuff.
325,"Of all of our pets, Scooby is the pickiest. She loves treats and to steal table food so her dry food habits are terrible. Luckily, she is not as picky when it comes to treats.

 liked the flavor and I will order this item again.  So many choices!"

She was super excited and loved this wet food! We will continue to buy other fun flavors for her to try :-)"
332,"I usually don't buy 'chunky' canned food but thought I'd give this one a try - it doesn't have chicken in it, which my dog is allergic to - and he can't get enough of it! Will buy this one again."

350,I buy this all the time at the pet store and just recently started purchasing it here on chewy.com because the price is better when buying 12/pk.  My dog loves this food and I feel good about her eating quality food.
351,This food was recommended by the emergency vet when my dog had a serious IBD attack. It has a new protein (duck) that my dog has never  eaten. She seems to like it and is eating regularly so she will probably be on it for the rest of her life.

There aren't too many options out there that truly have no poultry ingredients and this is her favorite. Every time I give her this, she gobbles it down! Its also nice that it comes finely ground since she "
356,"It is not as stew-y as I expected based on other brands of stews I have purchased. By that I mean there is really not a gravy like you would expect to see. In fact, the texture is more like a canned meat. That said, my girls LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!! I have a Yorkipoo and a Papipoo and they absolutely inhale"
357,Made meal time so much better for my pup! Half way through eating he would get bored and lose interest in his dry food. I only add a spoonful to echt meal and mix into the dry food and he eats every last bit! Licks the bowl clean and is one happy pup!
358,"I have a dog with food allergies. No lamb, rice, or sweet potatoes. Blue Buffalo has identifiable ingredients and I have multiple choices in this food line to feed my dog. My only constructive comment is the ingredients should be listed in bigger print. It is difficult to read."

After much research we decided upon Beyond canned foods in addition to a grain free dry food.  She absolutely loves the Beyond.  So, she loves it and"
367,"My mommy loves to shop Chewy for my favorite foods and treats that she  can buy in bulk.  The Cesar Home Delights has veggies that I don't have to try and sneak off her plate when she's not looking - LOL.  
I get sooooo excited when she reaches for my tray that I have been known to have little accidents"
368,"We supplement this for our dogs at dinner time each day along with their dry Merrick grain free dog food. They love it....as soon as they hear the bowls...they come running.  
There are so many benefits for them going grain free! We have noticed the difference in their joint issues. Highly recommend"
369,"My puppy is trying many brands of dog food and she is very picky, I shouldn't have gotten her to eat wet food, she doesn't like dry now, anyway she doesn't want to move away from her bowl when I give her this brand."
370,"I have a cattle dog/husky mix, 8 months old.  I guess she has listened to the cats on now to be picky about food.  :/
Seems like she gets tired of foods quickly and turns her nose up.  This food is pretty simple.  It has shreds of chicken or beef, depending on flavor, some veggies and bits of pumpkin"
371,"My dog loves this food and I mix it with his kibbles, just half a container so it last me quiet some time. The food looks good enough that almost seems like people's food. You can actually see the shredded chicken. I just wish that a whole case could be made of different flavors. I know there is the "
372,"This is the first time I've ordered Wellness canned dog food for our dogs. I mix it in with their dry food. They absolutely love it!!! I am very pleased that it is 95% chicken, grain free...completely a nutritious choice for our lab and cocker! It is reasonably priced as well. I'll never purchase another"
373,"My senior Pekingese suddenly developed a food allergy. She was itchy & miserable. Full body rash & itchy raw toosh. I switched her to this & in the 1st 24 hrs, her rash faded alot. By 48 hrs, rash gone & toosh was looking much less irritated. Now she's been on it for a wk & you can't even tell she had"
374,"One thing to bring to your attention and this doesn't effect my purchase. But, for what it's worth, there were 12 cans of food out of 24 that were dented. Dented cans were in both lots of 12. The reason I mention this is that it clearly wasn't your fault but it might effect a retail store's inventory"
375,I have a senior doxie who had begun to lose lots of weight. I added this food as a supplement to her meals and her appetite is so much better. She is excited for lunch and dinner time again. I feel so much better knowing that she is getting the nourishment that she needs as an aging girl. She is still

377,Our dogs have been eating this for years because they like it and keeps them at healthy weight
378,"Forced to change dog foods, I was looking for a food low in carbs high in protein that looked and smelled appetizing. The grain-free recipes from Merrick fit the bill. 
The meat and the veggies are recognizable and it doesn't have that horrible canned dog food smell. My dogs love it!"
379,"My Shiba Inu, Tibetan Spaniel and Albino Shih Tzu/Lhasa Apso all love this food. They sit there and wait for me to fix it, usually they just lay around and ignore but when I open the can I have an audience waiting! So happy I found them this food!!!"
380,"I am so glad i found this 27 count pack on chewy ! My girl is a picky eater but loves the food,but it was so hard to find a large pack . Buying small packs was costly and time consuming.Thanks to Chewy it will come straight to the door right on time ! Thanks Chewy :)"
381,I am still researching what canned food to feed my overweight pug girl.  This is what I've gone with for the last 2 months.  This works to get her interested in eating her food right away due to me feeding my pack twice daily.  Sophie is 5 years old and my precious 4 legged baby and I want to do the 
382,"My dogs love this food.  They devour it.  And I love it because it doesn't cause my dogs to have gas like a lot of canned food.  And their poo is solid, easy to pick up, not a globby, disgusting mess."
383,"Oliver gets wet food every other evening for dinner. The other meals are dry food. He has Spaniel ears which soak up any liquid in his food, and this has just the right amount to satisfy him without soaking his ears. If you have any breed with long floppy ears, you know what I mean. He loves the flavor"
384,"I like to add a little wet to my 2 dog's dry food. This is the perfect size to split 1 pouch between the 2 and not have left overs to worry about. One dog can be very finicky and wouldn't always eat the old canned food,  but no walking away without eating anymore."
385,"Like this brand and dogs like it also like the beef. I like this better because it is not in chunks so I can give vitamins or medicine in it. Dogs don't seem to care but have had some that don't like the chunks. Very moist, I mix with their dry."
386,"We keep trying to find a canned food to add to the dry food we feed our lab.  Finally, we decided to try the Merrick and started with the Steak Tips Dinner.  So far, our dog loves it and looks forward to mealtime.  We are looking forward to trying some of the other dinners from Merrick."

388,"Not that Topper (12 year old, 75# Australian Shepherd) is very picky about his food, but he really likes this.  I mix this with some Purina Bright Mind dry food, and T-man is back to working on string theory."
389,"My dog's trainer cuts this up and uses it as treats and the dogs go crazy for it! You need to keep it refrigerated but I usually just cube it up, put it in tupperware, and pull it out for training sessions. It's great because you really get a lot for your money and the soft texture is better for training"
390,How would I know how great it is....it is only dog food which is made from ingredients from human food so no big deal people..I taste it..some dog foods are disgusting tasting...too salty...too bland yet you expect your dog to eat it....the flavors this brand of food and the quality and taste is the 
391,My lab was having chronic ear infections and the vet thought perhaps it was an allergy. I selected this product to mix with dry and he loves it. Gobbles it up every morning. Was using Wellness Core and he was refusing to eat it lately though he had originally enjoyed it. Allergies seem to be improving
392,Well Ceasar is the only food my little girl Zoe will eat.  I'm going to try to add some  Blue hard food mixed in with life source bits for added quality.
393,"My dog is dancing in circles every night around feeding time. She used to eat at random times and leave food in her bowl for hours or all day, but now she cant wait to eat. Easy to open and pour in bowl with out using a utensil. Pour over dry food too! She cleans her bowl every night."
394,"This is a review of the Caesar filets food, but I have to mention that recently our English Bulldog (Bella) had not been doing well. At almost 12 years old, she's outlived most of her breed. As is typical with Bulldogs (and short nose breeds), she started to have more trouble lately breathing. She couldn't"

I decided to go to the pet store and read all the ingredients in canned dog food to find one she was able to eat. I found Natural Balance and  I thought would work and"
396,I have had excellent service when ordering from Chewy. I had recently purchased this dog food because my 13 year old West Terrier (diagnosed with terminal cancer) was shying away from his other food. He stopped eating and drinking and started having spasms a week later and we had to end his suffering
397,My Vet just put my older dog on Hill's Prescription Diet and he loves it.  I love getting it from Chewy as the Vet charges too much and I have to go there to get it.  Chewy ships free and I receive it within 2 days.  Great service.  I had been using Chewy for his kibble prior to this and also have bought
398,"We were recently advised to begin our dog on Hill's C/D prescription food. After researching where to buy, Chewy had the  best price and offered the best service. I placed the order and had it within 2 days. I was impressed with their service and price. Since this is something my Bailey will need for"
399,My dogs ate this just fine. I personally don't like a big blob of mush. I mix wet food with their dry food and this type takes too long to mix with so many dogs. I prefer pieces with a smoother gravy for mixing. I probably won't buy it again.
400,"Relatively fresh and good looking stew. The chunks of chicken are a good size.  Mixes well with my dog's dry prescription food.  Milo wouldn't eat the dry stuff if it weren't for the addition of the stew, so it's a lifesaver. We used to cook a similar product from scratch, but it was a pain. Autoship"
401,"My dog Bella will not eat! We have tried just about every product, both wet and dry. She prefers treats! She also prefers to be fed from a table spoon instead of eating like a dog! SHE LOVES THIS FOOD! I am still feeding her, but now she is eating her food. Bless You!"
402,I was impressed with Chewy's ability to contact my Vet when my dog was prescribed a special canned dog food.  Chewy notified me that they would do this.  They further notified me that the food was ready to be shipped.  With no effort on my part my dog got her special food.
403,"This is Topper, Mike's dog.  I don't trust Mike to write this review.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!  Love it, love it, love it. I'd order it myself but I can't do the keys (his password was a piece of cake - I'm an Aussie).  How good is it?  If you serve it on a sesame bun, it's a doggy bacon cheeseburger."
404,"A healthy, no-chicken (for my allergic chiweenie) canned food. Both of my dogs (the other is a retreagle) love it, and the price is far less than grocery or pet store prices! Chewy is now my goto pet store!"
405,"My 3 dogs love this!  I use a tablespoon of it everyday in their same L.I. D. food with a bit of water, they run to their dishes!!  Plus the shipping is AWESOME!!!  Received literally in 2 days!"

Thanks Chewy for making it so easy."
407,"Now that my lab has to eat softer food due to surgery he had, it was hard finding a high quality, grain free dog food. He is pretty picky about his food and knows what he likes and dislikes. It has been difficult finding one he would eat. I found that he does not like the canned food that has 95% meat"
408,"I mix this in with HS Diet advanced fitness dry food for my German shepherd and golden retriever. I thought I'd switch it up since I usually get the HS Diet healthy cuisine stew. They both LOVE each of the canned foods equally as much, but I can't stand the smell of this stuff, so I'll probably go back"
409,When my Vet found crystals in my morkie's urine he prescribed Science Diet Urinary Care food and gave us a few cans of the regular food to try.  He suggested mixing half of the food with her regular food for a few days to gradually change over.  Snookie did not like the food and stopped eating.  Knowing
410,I am very satisfied with Chewy and the dog food is amazing for my sweet girl. She was just diagnosed as being diabetic and she loves the food so much that it keeps her mind off getting her shot. lol  Will definitely recommend this site to family and friends. Thanks Chewy..
411,"These little portions are ideal for mixing with dry food, no matter how large or how small the dog.  The other varieties from the same maker are like little blocks of jelled food and do not mix well at all.  My big dog thinks he's in heaven with this on his food.  When mixed with dry food, the little"
412,I love the fast shipping and the variety of items. I love buffalo can food they really are tasty i tried a taste because my dogs seems to gooble it with a pasion  it was good and healthy  love chewy
413,I feed my dog pro plan dry dog food and I've tried him on several wet foods. He wouldn't eat the more expensive canned foods.  He loves pedigree and it doesn't upset his stomach so that's what I'm going to feed him. No point in buying a more expensive or fancier food if he won't eat it.
414,"Our Vet had recently discovered high levels on Casey's bloodwork, re: Kidneys. Another test was almost normal. I had tried Hill's Regular canned diet.  I've had her tested 2 times since, and the phosphorus level had gone up. She's almost 14, so I thought I'd try a different flavor. I got her the dry "
415,This is a great product that's made right here in the USA. It's grain free and contains meat along with various fruits. I do have a smaller dog so I had to make the chunks a little smaller for her meal. I have a long hair chihuahua and she seemed to like the taste of the food! *We received this item 
416,"My tiny chihuahua girl, Harley, absolutely LOVES this food! She's 13 years old and eating dry dog food is difficult for her. But she gobbles these Little Caesars flavors down and barks for more! I'd definitely recommend it, especially for smaller dogs."
417,"I was very impressed with the manner in which my package of two cases of canned dog food and a bag of dry dog food arrived. It cases were incased in a heavy duty corrugated cardboard box inside the bigger box with the bag of dry food. The cans were perfect, no dings or dents. The bag of dog food was "
418,"I have a little dog that is very fussy what she eats. I have finally found a can dog food, wolf creek stew, that she loves. I put some stew on top of her dry dog food and it's gone before I know it.  Thank you chewy for having such a great selection of dog foods."
419,"This is the best diet to give your pet if they have kidney disease.  
Also very bland so good on sensitive tummies too!  
My dog (Autumn-10 yr old SF brindle boxer)  prefers the original pate version (which I think is gross) but as long as she eats it and likes it I am fine with that.  =-).  They also"

I hope she does not tire of this one - there seems to be no sign of that happening"
426,I have one of the fussiest dogs on the planet!!  The only food I could get her to eat was Newman's Own canned.  My sister in law had a stroke and that's how I got the dog.  She used to feed her just dry food and maybe every now and again a spoon of canned.  She told me to leave the dry food out and she'd
427,My elderly dog was getting frail in his old age so I decided to switch him to wet food. He wasn't eating much of his dry food & I was concerned with him getting proper nutrition. He loves this and I've seen the improvement after just a couple of weeks.
428,"My vet put my dog on the Hills pate form of this food years ago because she had a hard time going potty, and it's worked wonders!  She's had no more problems since starting it!

429,One of my dogs spent days at the emergency hospital with acute pancreatitis and this is the food that the doctors decided would be the safest for him.

432,"I tried the canned version of the Duck and Potato for my dogs to mix up their normal Duck and Potato dry food. Needless to say, they love it so much that one of them won't eat the dry without a lil' wet duck/potato mixed in. He loves it too much! Highly recommend Natural Balance LID foods!"
433,"I bought Alpo wet dog food, Beggin Strips and Milkbone Dog Biscuits, all of which we have been using for quite a while. The most impressive is the quick delivery. Super Service is what I call chewy.com.

Thanks for making it easier to care for our dog Foxy."

She usually eats pretty well, but every few months she turns her nose up at the food and refuses to eat, so we have to switch it up.  This food does"
437,"This is so much easier than putting five cases of can dog food in the cart, pushing it out to the car, lifting and loading it in the car full of groceries, then unloading to carry into the house. I'm to old for this stuff. Just deliver to my front door, ring my bell and the mail man helps lift it up "

439,"I have a mini-schnauzer that gets bladder stones and has been prescribed this food by our Vet.  In the past, we have purchased only the dry version but now mix the dry and wet together.  Just a small amount of the wet mixed in with the dry makes all the difference.  Plus, she is missing some of her teeth"

His poops are finally solid!  We also like to mix the wet food with the dry food and put in a kong and freeze. This

445,"My dog is older, and finicky. He eats at least two of these trays daily (along with dry food). He will only eat pate..no chunks, flakes or slivers. He really loves this stuff. Other than the bogo coupons that in stores, Chewy has the best price I have found."

The Vet said Eddie should be restricted to a low fat diet and recommended Royal Canin Low Fat dog food.  It has worked
449,I mix this with my pups dry food in the evening and you'd think I put down a Med/Rare Filet Mignon with a red wine reduction sauce on top.

470,"My two dogs LOVE this fish food best of all the Avoderm flavors available. I like that it's a chunky stew cause you can see the carrots & peas. I do mash it a bit cause my guys are small (silky Terrier & Chi/Russel mix) but, no matter what form it's in, they can't get it down fast enough!"

483,"Due to my dog's mainly yeast triggered itching, was looking for a non- kibble gf 1 ingredient food with a low fat percentage. This Canine Caviar Goat fits that bill better than anything else I found. I've noticed after just a week without any yeast-feeding potatoes, she's scratching much less already"
484,Love this product and would have given you 5 stars but for so many damaged cans. I was surprised to find over a quarter of the case were badly squished. Have sent photos to Customer Service.
485,"I mostly feed this to my cats. They are older and one has too many digestive problems with other cat foods, I had to take them off of Blue Buffalo. I still feed them kibble (Merrick) for vitamin and mineral supplement. My dog has a spoonful on top of her food, she eats that with her Blue Buffalo as a"
486,"The French rabbits are one of his favorite flavors. The consistency of the product is itself good. 

 However, there is a substantial amount of liquid included with the meat. When you drain it through cheesecloth and press it as you would cheese. You definitely are not getting that 13.2 ounces of product"
487,"My pups luv Ziwipeak!! The ingredients are of the highest quality!! Everything fresh, no by products or undesirable ingredients like carrageenan or tripolyphosphates just to name a few!! BPA free cans!! Won't feed my pups any other canned food!! It is a great addition to their rotational diet of kibble"
488,"I love this company, no long list of ingredients on the label that don't survive the cooking process. I supplement their raw diet with this and their kibble Just for my ease of meal prep. Dogs love it so much they would open th can if they could. My Shepard has severe food allergies and this food is "
489,"My picky seniors like Dave's food, and especially the chicken & rice recipe.  I'm glad I discovered this line of food at Chewy's."
490,"Dogs liked the change, they like something different sometimes & this was like a treat for them. I usually use the Chicken,***** Mashed Potatoes & Gravy are good but you wouldn't want them every day after a while. Huh!!!!! ?"
491,This is the only product that camouflages my sick dog's pills. Unlike cheese or pill pockets she does not tire of them so we do not have to force them down. Makes the process much more pleasant for both of us. 4 months and counting!!
492,"The container is easy to open, use and dispose of and my dog simply loves this food--no leftovers ever."
493,My dog loves the Halo products and it is healthy for her.
494,Started my 16yr old Mini Schnauzer a few weeks ago. He really likes it and I mix it with the same brand of dry food. Got this to see if it would help him urinate less and with ease. So far so good.
495,What I like most about this product is that its a stew. Other canned foods look and smell disgusting. This one you can actually see the chunks of meat and all of the vegetables.
496,"My pit-mix loves this food. She had been on Fromm for several years. When Fromm discontinued working with Chewy, we gave this a try and no longer look for Fromm products."
497,"Mom has fed dry Nutro Ultra to her Chesapeake and Lab girls for several years with good results heath wise, and recently added a little of this canned to her Lab's diet after her Chessie passed away at age 13, and her Lab girl didn't want to eat. She has regained her appetite with the addition of the"
498,Chewy.com is a great place to buy food. Wild Calling dog food is a great product. I would highly recommend.
499,"Chewy.Com has been wonderful so far getting the product I need for our dog. A lot of time the store I normally purchase only carries a certain amount, which therefore makes us have to make several trips then to get the amount. Also pricing is much better to. Thank you Chewy if I wouldn't see your ad "
500,"We have been using Evander for several years now.  It was excellent, very pure.  I lowered the rating to a 4 due to the recent batches.  For about 4 months now, the fat in the can is excessive.  I know Lamb is high in fat but it never used to be in the cans like this"
501,"I know that this product is more expensive than most, but it has certainly been worth it. Mackenzie was very sick and not eating. I thought I'd try Weruva, as I feed it to my 2 cats. She dances when she sees it coming and licks the bowl clean! It is very high quality food."
502,"I have one dog with acid reflux. I feed her half this and half of a regular beef canned food. This stopped her problem cold. My other dog will skip meals on occasion. Normally, that's not such a big deal for dogs - but when SHE skips a meal she gets sick and vomits up bile. The Green Bison Tripe ""cured"
503,This seems to be a really excellent product and doesn't give any nonsense about being grain free. Most dogs don't need a grain free food but it's the latest selling hype. Forget it. This is good stuff. Look online for independent reviews and you find good ones for this brand.
504,All Natures Variety Instinct cans except the Venison formula have a lot of fluid in the can which is actually broth and very healthy. It's simply necessary to mix the food together before pouring it out of the can. We love the food because of that and because of the high quality ingredients. We rotate
505,"My very picky and sensitive Irish Setter likes this Stew, however he seems to have some stomach upset the next day. I also supplement him with dry dog food, Salmon Castor & Pollex that he also loves. Allergic to Chicken and other things, I have a hard time with his canned food, price wise to me and  "
506,ZiwiPeak Daily-Dog Beef Cuisine Grain-Free Canned Dog Food is great my dogs love it. As soon as they hear the can they come to the food bowl and wait.
507,Tried this brand and flavor while my dog was recovering from a stomach issue after discovering he had a chicken and beef intolerance.  The whitefish and sweet potato is perfect for him and causes no issues.  Quality is good and price is reasonable.  We travel frequently so I make sure we have plenty 
508,I'm trying one more pate fish based canned along with Dave's which I feed 90% of the time.  I try to keep one other in the mix in case I have to switch for any reason.  I had used Canidae's fish but it has been OS for a good while.  I tried others but were not pat and my SP liked them less with gravy
509,"My boy just loved this food, a little mixed in with his kibbles and he is back to looking forward to meal time"
510,"finally a wet dog food without rice and potatoes, in the process of treating my dog for a yeast infection in her gut, i have tried so many things through chewy that have not worked and chewy allowed me to trial and error their products. they refunded every order i was unhappy with and we were able to"
511,"What's not to like?! Ordering was simple, it arrived the next day, Jesse is happy and so are her people."
512,"My dog loves this stuff!! It is rather expensive because it is made in a human-grade facility and is GMO-free, grain-free, gluten-free, carrageenan free, and BPA free.  I thought I would try another brand....it just made my dog's colitis and acid reflux flare up...so we are back and won't ever switch"
513,My dogs are picky but they love Dave's canned food.  They especially like this flavor
514,"I was skeptical after reading reviews about the sausages, which are more like meatballs, being too big. We have one medium size dog and one larger lab. I cut the meatballs in half for our smaller dog but really don't need to. They both love the taste of this food. Our smaller dog is very picky, so was"
515,"My local pet store stopped carrying Evanger's a couple of months ago, so I was very excited to find it on Chewy AND explore some new flavors for my cats. They mainly eat turkey and chicken based canned food, so I try to supplement their diets with more exotic sources of protein. So far they've been loving"
516,"The smell isn't overwhelming when reheated like the salmon. I only wish it came in the smaller cans, my dogs are little and I always end up giving them a bit too much. Not that they mind."
517,"Am just a new first time buyer and it was so nice having the food delivered instead of having to haul it around and up stairs. Only comment: I know that old product needs to be sold first but this product is quite soupy and not firm like that purchased at pet store. Hopefully, this will improve quickly"
518,"My dog lost her appetite in the last 2 weeks of her gestation due to size of puppies compressing her stomach. I was at a loss on what would make her keep eating. I took a chance on this and it works. Her mouth literally drooled when I opened up the cans.
Unfortunately this causes food pickiness afterward"
519,"My puppy LOVES this food. We mix it with her dry Nutro food and she always cleans her bowl. Since we have started feeding her Nutro, her coat has gotten shinier and she has gone through a big growth spurt.  I love the quality ingredients and you get great quality for the money."
520,Another great wet food from Merrick! My dogs love all of the Merrick grain free foods. Healthy and delicious!
521,"My dogs love this food, I used it when I ran out of the frozen prepared food and it didn't cause any stomach upset at all and he was happy to eat it!"
522,"I bought this wet food for my yorkie (she normally eats solid gold dry dog food) to mix it with her dry food.  She loves it. Is looks delicioius, it looks like human food, and it smells sooo good. It has chunks of tender chicken in a thick gravy. When she sees me trying to open it, she gets impatient"
523,"Patches cannot wait till I put his dinner down.  
Wellness wet food has always been our choice but 
this one is the winner in my little doggie friends belly....."
524,"My small dog is a huge fan of the Weruva wet foods!  Since her owner has always given her human food, she loves the whole ingredient chicken & salmon/fish varieties.  She recently started protesting her healthy dry food, and so a spoonful of the wet mixed in makes her excited to eat and a small can lasts"
525,I bought this to add to my dog's dry food (same brand) and he loves it. He needed to gain some weight and he looks better after just a few weeks. Cooper looks for his meals now--
526,We refrigerate this to make it easier to slice and then cut up the entire roll and mix it with grain free dry food as needed for our two dogs.  We tried another brand and even when we kept it in the refrigerator it was too soft to cut easily and made a big mess. Dogs love every flavor we have tried so
527,"Gus eats it okay, but not with enthusiasm, so feed it to him in the morning when he is hungriest.  Seems to have the best fish ingredients, small sardines from the north Atlantic would have the least amount of pollution now that wild caught pacific salmon are showing up with radiation from Fukushima."
528,"We have two small, fussy eater dogs. I have tried many, many canned dog foods. Then I read The Whole Dog Journal's approved wet foods list. This wet dog food was on the approved list so I ordered it. Lo and behold, my fussy eaters will eat it! Yahoo!! I would highly recommend this canned wet dog food"
529,"This item is absolutely great, and Mikey loves it very much. He never liked any kind of fish. But to my surprise he gables it down."
530,"Like other reviewers, my 8 year old Chihuahua/mix loved the other brand that stopped making their venison canned food (which I don't understand, but whatever...) My pup has IBD and his Vet prescribed that original brand and he did well on it and he loved it. But he didn't like the other proteins (duck"
531,"All three of my westies have severe food allergies to Chicken, Beef, Turkey you name it there most likely allergic. So when I found Wild Callings Rabbit I decided to give it a shot and they LOVE it. They no longer give me a hard time eating. We also tried the buffalo and great too! No more allergies "
532,My dog loves this product so much he barley eats his Acana dry food. He seems to be thriving well with this addition to his diet.  Many people complained about the smell of this product to the point that I was worried that my family would complain.  But I have found that while this product does smell
533,Sophie loves this one! I think it's her favorite flavor!
534,My dog loves this food. You can see the vegitables and chuncks of meat. I bought it for her to celebrate Christmas and New Year.
535,My 13 year old greyhound had to have most of her teeth removed. She is still healing and is having this canned food the most because she loves it. We use other cans of Evangers and Taste of the Wild Salmon kibbles. This has been her favorite as she is healing.
536,"I am I believe almost ridiculously picky about what my girls eat and it's super hard to find a canned food that meets my criteria. Has to be fish based with only wild caught fish and no other animal proteins, grains or fillers and it cannot contain carrageenan. I have found about 4 on the market so far"
537,Have used evangers for the 3 years of my life and would'nt feed anything else. My groomer got me hooked and am very pleased. First time for  lamb stew. But was very yummy!!!
538,My dog loves this canned food. It actually smells and looks edible.  You can see the chicken and asparagus in it. I bought it for her because she had dental issues and she can eat this easier.
539,"My Josie likes this food a lot, but I may have to take it out of her canned food rotation -- it is so thick and stiff, it is very difficult to get out of the can. I can't not recommend it because it is such a wonderful vegetarian food, but I wish it was a little moister."
540,My Bichons love the canned and dry food. They have have had no problems changing over.
541,I homecook for my dog but every now & then I get busy & don't get to cook some meat/fish for her.  I like to keep these on hand for those times.  I don't trust a lot of pet food brands but this one I do trust.  Hannah loves it too.
542,I am well pleased with Newman's Own canned dog food.  Previously I purchased the liver and beef.  This is my first purchase of the organic liver but I have no doubt that my dog will like it.  It is definitely quality food.
543,"This certainly does have an ingredient list that reads like human-grade food, which was my goal for my dog that developed allergies. (It would be nice for Chewy to put up a picture of the ingredients for this product like they do for others on here.) She definitely likes the flavor, and I mix it with"
544,"My dog  usually eats the Evolve dry food but she had a problem with her  esophagus and the Vet told us she needs to eat canned food for awhile, so we got this a she loves it. I think I might keep mixing dry and wet now that she is better."
545,"My dog loves this canned dog food. Her coat is thicker and shinier since she started eating it some time ago. I mix it with Nature's Variety Instint Limited Ingredient kibble. She'd had to be on prescription dog food, which she'd stopped eating and started losing weight. Then I discovered Hound & Gatos"
546,"My big dog started getting picky about her dry food, and this has been perfect to add in with her dry food to make it extra delicious. One can lasts me 3-4 meals because there's a lot of juice and fish chunks that are easy to mix in, even when it's cold from the fridge. Also, the fish oil is great for"
547,My two dogs both love this food. My Pomeranian is very fussy. She wants a very soft food that I mix with a small amount of her dry food. My lab mix also likes the flavor of this food. I use a smaller amount added to her dry food. Both of my fur baby's are happy.
548,"I love to use this as a topper for my dogs, they currently eat a salmon based protein but being able to add Venison to their diet allows them to not only explore more flavor's but also build their tolerance to red meat. Definitely something to consider if you're trying to add more moisture or want to"
549,I have been feeding my dog canned food mixed with kibble. I have never heard of triumph pet food before i saw it on chewy. I decided to try it after reading the ingredients. The price was affordable as well. My dog ate the rice and vegetable formula quickly. She has never turned down any brand or flavor
550,"So far, my very picky eater will eat this when other canned dog food gets rejected. He's a senior and needs to take pills twice a day with food, so if he won't eat, he doesn't get his meds. I've been resorting to buying Hormel Smoked Ham in small tuna-can size tins. That usually works but isn't peak "
551,"My boxer has been getting Evangers canned food most all of his 8 years. I switch off different flavors. He really loves braised beef chunks, but that's unavailable at this time."
552,"Our 2 large 80-lb. dogs are eager eaters, but our little 12-lb Shitzhu/Maltese mix is very picky.  We wanted a grain-free canned food to add to the grain-free dry food and thought the little one might like Turkey with Chickpea.  OMG, she absolutely LOVES it!!  We use Autoship and switch to Succulent "
553,My dog has been picky with treats and food. He likes to eat the wet cat food and sneaks it when the cats are done eating. He loves this food because it's the same consistency and he happily eats it. He is a pretty picky dog so I give this 5 stars.
554,"Cats liked the flavor, but not the texture, it's a pate, but not a smooth pate."
555,"Our dog was beaten so bad that he has no teeth and his right jaw is not connected. This is the prefect one for him after 10 plus cases of trial and error. I still and will always make his food mushy ! If you do or do not have a rescue dog, try this dog food."
556,"Nutrisca Turkey is the only diet that my Jack Russell can eat. Once I discovered he suffered from allergies, I needed a grain and potato free option. He's been well ever since and just celebrated his 13th birthday."
557,My yorkie LOVES this food and I believe she is getting the proper nutrition she needs. Thank you for a wonderful product!
558,One of our dogs has weak teeth since birth. We mix this with her dry food and she loves it. Great consistency and quality ingredients. Dealing with Chewy is pleasure as well. FAST delivery and free shipping!
559,Our dogs really liked this flavor of food. I liked that it had vegetables in the mix. I feel it is a good quality food for our dogs.
560,My husband and I rescued a dog from I-5 North Coalinga/Avenal rest stop - She was very pregnant - Our two dogs fell in love with her also - She gave birth to 5 very healthy puppies (4 boys and 1 girl).   We have named her Katie and she is such a love - The puppies love the taste of this puppy food although
561,"There are many similar alternatives, but as a topper to kibble, this one is fine.  I picked duck as one option just to add a little variety to my dog's diet.  

Lightning fast delivery.  I have gotten to the point if the dog food is not on Chewie's list, it probably is not going to get to my dogs."
562,I got this to mix in with our new puppy's food and he loves it!  The only reason I am rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is drier and harder to mix in with the kibble than other canidae canned foods.
563,"I have a chi mix, she is very picky. I use this Evangers, and she likes it. This Evangers is all protein, so it has to be mixed with something like Sojo's to be balanced. The label also states it is considered a supplement."
564,We recently adopted a 2 yr old Bulldog with lots of allergies. After a lot of research this canned food is one he can have. We use it to supplement his kibble... he loves it! Gobbles it down and I'm happy to give him something of this quality.
565,"My dog doesn't like treats, biscuits and whatever someone says, ""all dogs like these."" He LOVED this food.  His previous brand gave him rancid gas issues, so we had to switch. This one has solved that problem too. I highly recommend!"
566,"I have 9 cats, some of whom are picky eaters. All of them ate this when offered. I've only fed it once, but it's in the rotation and hopefully they will continue to eat it!"
567,Our 3 dogs just love this food. Turn their noses up at other brands. Worth every penny.
568,This is not a stand alone dog feed according to my vet.  It's to be added to your normal raw or high quality can food as an additional additive.  It's been a great addition to my dogs probiotics for his allergies and scratching.
569,It's hard to find canned food that my pit mix really likes but he absolutely gobbles up the duck and rabbit flavors. Excellent food that is dog approved! Win win!
570,"Evangers canned Duck makes an excellent topper to mix in with the regular Fromm kibble we feed our two dogs. Both the Duck and the Beef flavors our dogs devour their food when this is added. 

It's very fresh, the 6 ounce cans are perfect to split between both dogs meals. The protein level in it seems"
571,They loved it! I loved that it's organic! I mix with dry food that they are not excited about snd they eat everything!
572,"This is a high quality, low fat dog food for my dog with pancreatitis. I like the company because their foods are organic and this one is well tolerated by my lab. Her pancreatitis has been well controlled on this food - that's a winner for me, and her."
573,"My Chihuahua just loves this food
She looks forward to mealtime and circles around in excitement
I really hope they never stop making it"
574,My dogs seem to love the food.  My 12 year old dog is in great shape. He doesn't look like an old dog he doesn't move like an old dog. I attributed that to good food and good treats.  My two-and-a-half-year-old dog is also in great shape. No fat on these dogs. I think the food has a lot to do with it
575,Took my 15 year old mini doxie to my vet and was told this food is fantastic and doing great things for her vitality
576,"My dog loved the wellness core dry food but lately was getting picky and wasn't eating much. I added this in with his wet food and his ate it within seconds!He loved the taste and especially the middle ""chunky"" part!"
577,"My senior dog seems to like this okay right now, but she doesn't seem to want the same thing for long anymore.  She does pick the peas out, however, and lay them on the side of her feeder:)"
578,"Dogswell Vitality was recommended by a vet specialist after my older Bull Terrier was diagnosed with Cushing's disease. He eats everything, but my younger Bullie is very picky with her food and she gobbles her whole bowl now!"
579,I have a Xoloitzcuintle (hairless dog) who has very sensitive skin. He loves this food and I believe it helps keep his hide from getting so dry. I have noticed that I haven't had to moisturize him quite as often.
580,"I am feeding against the grain products to both my dogs and cats; I have very picky eaters, but all six of my animals run to the food bowl and dive in. This is a great product ."
581,"I have two English Bulldogs - the older of my two is a very picky eater. She absolutely LOVES these stews. Not one morsel is left after she finishes eating. Makes me so happy! Love Chewy for their products, prices and service! Amazing!!!!!"
582,"I was looking for a limited ingredient, high quality canned food - both to add to my dogs kibble, and to put his medication in. I purchased the Duck variety. Unfortunately the product is too soupy/runny to hide medication in when first opened up. It does thicken up a bit when placed in the refrigerator"
583,"I had just adopted a 2 1/2 Old English Bulldog who would only pick at his food. When I added this to his dry dog food, he couldn't wait to eat and leaves nothing in the bowl."
584,"We've been going crazy trying to figure out what our dog is allergic to. Vet said allergy testing isn't 100% accurate, so recommended going grain free. Did that-dog still was scratching and losing hair. Food with potatoes seemed like it made it even worse. Saw this at a grocery store and decided to try"
