My 2 dogs had no problem switching from their old dog food to this!  They LOVE it!  AND.....it is so much healthier for them as well.,1
"Their attention span has improved, more playful and their coats are healthier!  ",1
"The oldest, Frank the pug, is 7 and showed no interest in play any longer. Even my 3 year old Sassy left the toys laying and was becoming lethargic.",1
"Both of them are perked up, happy and playful and the toys are scattered everywhere again!  This pup Mom is very happy.",1
Oh yeah!!  The price and convenience are the icing on the cake!!!,2
We've been trying to find a good food to replace a brand we used to use that changed their formula.  ,2
Gave this a try and our doxie loves it.,2
" It's a pate, but doesn't get overly hard in the fridge, which is nice.",2
"It's organic with only healthy ingredients, which is very important to us, and best of all, it's priced very affordable.",2
"We've tried several brands trying to find what works best for her, and Newmans Own is the clear winner.",2
Maggie loves this stuff! Maggie is 1 yr old Pointer mix and weighs 54 lbs.,3
"Some reviewers seem disappointed by the contents of the can, which I could see, but I was looking for a stew/gravy topping for Maggie's hard food and this is great for us!",3
It is great as a topping for her hard food. The bones are an added treat.,3
At first I was concerned but realize now that they are totally safe for her to consume and she eats them up.,3
With all the dog food out there its often hard to say what is good or not.  ,4
 I heard of this through a coworker and his dog trainer recommended it.,4
"But I was disappointed to find it was such a processed product, looking like mush which I hate.",4
I prefer food that has more whole food in it and has some toothsomeness,4
I was surprised my two large dogs didn't like this food more;  it looks wholesome enough...and the ingredients seem fine.        ,5
"They eat it but not with gusto.......one dog kind of noses around the meat, eating the kibble and then tentatively eating the meat chunks.",5
I think I will look on Chewy again for another canned wet food until I find something they love.,5
They don't like salmon so maybe they don't like beef too.,5
"After reading about this food, I thought our doodles ""might"" like this food! Unfortunately, it was not to be!    ",6
"They just  took one sniff and walked away...I let it set out for them, but nope...they just would not take one bite.",6
"I have to admit..I go by the smell of the foods I feed my pets, both the dogs and our cat, ",6
"although this food looks good, I did not smell chicken and for that reason, I think the dogs did not eat it.",6
"I tried to feed it to our daughter's doodle, she is the Mikey of the bunch, ""she eats anything"". She too, just sniffed and walked away...",6
"For that reason, I cannot give this food a high rating. I am still searching for a food that our dogs",6
Do like other than the chicken that we cook and feed to them. I am open to suggestions! I will just give this food to someone or Community Aid...,6
