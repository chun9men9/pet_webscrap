"My 2 dogs had no problem switching from their old dog food to this!  They LOVE it!  AND.....it is so much healthier for them as well. Their attention span has improved, more playful and their coats are healthier! The oldest, Frank the pug, is 7 and showed no interest in play any longer. Even my 3 year old Sassy left the toys laying and was becoming lethargic.",Positive,1
"Regarding AGAINST THE GRAIN DOG FOOD. My girl has a liver disease, so I have been searching for better foods for her & while on vacation in CA I purchased a can of the Chicken & couldn't believe it when I opened the can & found CHICKEN CHUNKS with a thin gravy over it WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE! Now that we are back home I went on the internet to find out where we could purchase more. THANK YOU Chewy.com for carrying this wonderful product! We shall now have to try the Beef. My girl totally LOVED this food. Also i wish to thank Against the grain for making this wonderful pet food as our pets deserve the best we can do for them.",Positive,2
I like the high standards of this product. This is a high quality food that my very picky senior citizen Chihuahua will eat without hesitation every time!,Positive,3
"Both of them are perked up, happy and playful and the toys are scattered everywhere again!  This pup Mom is very happy.",Positive,4
Oh yeah!!  The price and convenience are the icing on the cake!!! We've been trying to find a good food to replace a brand we used to use that changed their formula. ,Positive,5
"Gave this a try and our doxie loves it.  It's a pate, but doesn't get overly hard in the fridge, which is nice. Maggie loves this stuff! Maggie is 1 yr old Pointer mix and weighs 54 lbs.",Positive,6
"It's organic with only healthy ingredients, which is very important to us, and best of all, it's priced very affordable. We've tried several brands trying to find what works best for her, and Newmans Own is the clear winner.",Positive,7
"Some reviewers seem disappointed by the contents of the can, which I could see, but I was looking for a stew/gravy topping for Maggie's hard food and this is great for us!",Positive,8
It is great as a topping for her hard food. The bones are an added treat. At first I was concerned but realize now that they are totally safe for her to consume and she eats them up.,Positive,9
I have been buying the pulled chicken for almost a year and absolutely loved the chunks of chicken and yummy vegetables that were jammed into each can. There was just a little bit of broth and it always smelled really good. I just received a case and was surprised at the amount of liquid in the can. The chicken looked different too. NOTHING about this food looks the same. What happened? I contacted Chewy and they are giving me a refund for the case. Thank you Chewy for being so nice about this! Such a shame!!,Negative,10
"But I was disappointed to find it was such a processed product, looking like mush which I hate. I prefer food that has more whole food in it and has some toothsomeness",Negative,11
"My dog just wont eat it. Wont even look at it. Also, when I open the can there seems to be so much solid fat at the top of the can. I have been removing this fat but its really bad for your dog. I hope everyone else is removing it. Well I wont be buying this again since my dog dont like it.",Negative,12
Was hoping they'd like this combo but they didn't. They seem bored with their regular food so I'm trying some find something different for them. These cans are unlike any I have bought at local feed store! Doesn't look like chicken looks like beef in both color and texture,Negative,13
I think I will look on Chewy again for another canned wet food until I find something they love. They don't like salmon so maybe they don't like beef too.,Negative,14
"After reading about this food, I thought our doodles ""might"" like this food! Unfortunately, it was not to be!  For that reason, I cannot give this food a high rating. I am still searching for a food that our dogs. I have been buying the pulled chicken for almost a year and absolutely loved the chunks of chicken and yummy vegetables that were jammed into each can. There was just a little bit of broth and it always smelled really good. I just received a case and was surprised at the amount of liquid in the can. The chicken looked different too. NOTHING about this food looks the same. What happened? I contacted Chewy and they are giving me a refund for the case. Thank you Chewy for being so nice about this! Such a shame!!  ",Negative,15
"They just  took one sniff and walked away...I let it set out for them, but nope...they just would not take one bite. Although three of our dogs seem to like it, our fussy one will not touch it, even leaving the room. Some of the cans have been about 25% juice, so it's not especially economical.",Negative,16
Don't waste your money. This product is WAY overprice for the ingredients. VERY VERY LITTLE EEL!!! Will not buy again ,Negative,17
"Two of my senior dogs were gradually introduced to Wysong and the result was not at all satisfactory with both having severe diarrhea. I decided to remove both, feeding chicken and creme of rice prepared from scratch to relieve their distress. Will not be using Wysong products again.",Negative,18
