My 2 dogs had no problem switching from their old dog food to this!  They LOVE it!  AND.....it is so much healthier for them as well.
"Their attention span has improved, more playful and their coats are healthier!  "
"The oldest, Frank the pug, is 7 and showed no interest in play any longer. Even my 3 year old Sassy left the toys laying and was becoming lethargic."
"Both of them are perked up, happy and playful and the toys are scattered everywhere again!  This pup Mom is very happy."
Oh yeah!!  The price and convenience are the icing on the cake!!!
